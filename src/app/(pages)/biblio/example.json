  "SCORE": 3,
  "SCORE_JUSTIFICATION": "The article title and abstract focus on cognitive development and prenatal adversities, but not specifically on cannabis exposure.",
  "TYPE_JUSTIFICATION": "The abstract pertains to the impact of prenatal adversities on cognitive development and brain gray matter, moderated by genetic factors. It seems to be a longitudinal study analyzing developmental trajectories.",
  "TYPE": "Longitudinal Study",
  "METHODS": "The study likely uses neuroimaging techniques and genetic analysis to assess brain gray matter and cognitive development in relation to prenatal adversities.",

    "Cognitive development trajectories",
    "Influence of prenatal adversities",
    "Role of prefrontal cortex",

  "BKT_JUSTIFICATION": "The study provides insights into how genetic factors can moderate the impact of prenatal adversities on cognitive and brain development. It adds a nuanced understanding but does not represent a groundbreaking change in the field.",
  "BKT": "Incremental Advance",
  "INCLUDE_SCORE": 4,
  "INCLUDE_JUSTIFICATION": "While the study is relevant to prenatal influences on brain development, it does not focus on the specific effects of cannabis exposure."
