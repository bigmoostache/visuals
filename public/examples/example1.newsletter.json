      "complete_entry": "Nissan starts manufacturing new Qashqai from Sunderland plant in UK\n Motoring Trends, MT Bureau, Tuesday, 28  May 2024, 1170 Words, Copyright 2024 Motoring Trends(Document MOTTRD0020240528ek5s0002u) Mumbai, May 28 -- Nearly 18 years ago the first Nissan Qashqai rolled off the production line in Sunderland, UK, and with more than four million customers in more than 100 countries, the fastest-selling car ever in the UK car industry has been upgraded once more. The new Qashqai, electrified with Nissan's unique e-Power system, is now in production in Sunderland ahead of its arrival in the coming weeks to Nissan dealers across Europe and beyond. The latest upgrades required a fresh GBP 30 million investment in the plant, building on Nissan's total investment in the UK of GBP 6 billion. The refreshed Qashqai arrives as Nissan continues to develop its EV36Zero vision in Sunderland, a blueprint for the future of automotive manufacturing, bringing together electric vehicle manufacturing and battery production, powered by renewables. Adam Pennick, Nissan's Vice President for Manufacturing in the UK, said: \"We're so proud to call Sunderland plant the home of the Qashqai. Having the number one team behind the number one crossover is a winning formula, and we can't wait to see how much our customers enjoy the new design and extra tech.\" The Qashqai was designed, engineered and built in Britain; and was produced in Sunderland towards the end of 2006, ahead of its launch in 2007. Its instant popularity saw production in Sunderland reach record levels, with the plant recording the highest annual volumes in the history of the UK car industry, and Qashqai becoming the fastest UK-built car to achieve 1 million, 2 million, 3 million and then 4 million production units, spawning more than 20 competitors in the process. Sunderland Plant is also home to the Nissan Juke and all-electric Nissan Leaf, where production supports 7,000 jobs in Nissan's UK teams. That includes Nissan's Design Centre in Paddington, London, the Technical Centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, the manufacturing team in Sunderland, parts centre in Lutterworth and sales and marketing team in Rickmansworth, as well as a further 30,000 jobs in the UK supply chain. Since the third-generation Qashqai was launched in 2021, it has sold more than 350,000 units in Europe and continues to set the standard for crossovers. In 2022 Qashqai became available with e-Power - Nissan's unique and innovative electrified powertrain where the wheels are only ever driven directly by the electric motor - creating an EV- drive sensation. More than 120,000 Sunderland-built Qashqais with e-Power are now on the roads. The company has made several changes across Sunderland plant to enable production of the 2024 Qashqai, with investment in facilities for new panels, bumpers, paint colours, interior features, materials and trim. New Qashqai's upgraded technology is now also integrated into the production process - including updated advanced driver assistance systems and the addition of Google built-in as part of the NissanConnect infotainment system, which makes a near-seamless interaction between a customer's digital life and their vehicle. Nissan EV36Zero, the company's blueprint for the future of automotive, combines EV and battery manufacturing with renewables, with a goal of zero emissions driving and zero emissions manufacturing. The EV36Zero model will become a blueprint for the future for plants across Nissan's global manufacturing footprint as part of The Arc, Nissan's new global business plan. The Japanese automaker has already confirmed for production in Sunderland are future all-electric versions of Qashqai, Juke and Leaf, part of plans for Nissan's passenger car line-up in Europe to be 100 percent electric by 2030. It also builds on Nissan's Ambition 2030 vision to become a truly sustainable company, driving towards a cleaner, safer, and more inclusive world. UK pricing announced Nissan GB has also announced pricing for the new model, which will start from GBP 30,135 and is available with a mild hybrid petrol engine or Nissan's unique e-Power technology. E-Power uses a pure electric motor with direct drive to the wheels to deliver instant, high torque and linear response. It offers drivers the sensation of driving an EV without having to think about charging - an ideal stepping-stone for customers who aren't quite ready to make the switch to 100 percent EV yet. All models feature significant interior and exterior design changes, including a bigger 12.3-inch infotainment screen and uplifts to interior materials quality. Google Automotive Services and upgraded Around View Monitor technology are also added to most models, together with enhanced exterior lighting and updated alloy wheel options. Another new addition to the Qashqai line-up is the N-Design grade (from GBP 34,845) featuring bold design upgrades and unique aesthetic touches. On the exterior, the lower body portion below the doors and the wheel arches are body-coloured on N-Design. There are also unique, all-new 20-inch alloy wheels which bring added on-road presence. The refreshed Qashqai is also the first vehicle in Nissan's European range with the suite of Google built-in, which makes a near-seamless interaction between a customer's digital life and their vehicle. The updated Qashqai is available with Google Maps and, once signed-in, with a personal Google Account drivers can access their favourite locations and points of interest. This reduces the dependence on a mobile phone and cellular phone network. Over the air updates ensure the map information is always current. One of the most commonly used features on the Qashqai - Around View Monitor - has been significantly upgraded and now features a 3D function which allows the driver to see the car not only from above but also from one of eight different external camera viewpoints. This helps the driver visualise the car from the front, rear, sides or corners to potentially identify any unseen exterior hazards. Additionally, a feature known as \"invisible hood view\" allows the driver to see the position of the front wheels as if looking through the dashboard and engine bay, helping drivers to precisely manoeuvre in tight locations, such as multi-story car parks where there are concrete curbs which would damage a wheel. This view uses machine learning to create the image based on what the front camera can see in front, with the wheels super-imposed into the view to give a sense of perspective. Diana Torres, MD, Nissan GB said: \"The original Qashqai pioneered the crossover vehicle category that is so popular with customers today and, over the last 18 years, it has become a hugely successful icon of the UK motoring industry. Its unique combination of design, performance and technology ensure it stays ahead of rivals and these latest upgrades will reinforce its place as one of the nation's favourite new cars to buy.\" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Motoring Trends.",

Un virage vers l'\u00e9lectrique qui n'est pas sans cons\u00e9quences sur les activit\u00e9s et la main d'\u0153uvre de la fili\u00e8re et qui vient s'ajouter \u00e0 une conjoncture \u00e9conomique fragile. \u00c0 l'image de l'usine Benteler \u00e0 Migennes qui a ferm\u00e9 ses portes en 2022, la r\u00e9gion a perdu 10% de ses effectifs dans la fili\u00e8re en cinq ans, selon une r\u00e9cente \u00e9tude de l'Insee*. D\u00e9cryptage. Une conjoncture \u00e9conomique difficile qui s'ajoute \u00e0 des mutations structurelles profondes. Depuis 15 ans, le secteur de l'automobile en Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9 fait face \u00e0 des d\u00e9fis majeurs. Aux cons\u00e9quences toujours pr\u00e9sentes de la crise sanitaire et la p\u00e9nurie de semi-conducteurs se greffent une r\u00e9volution \u00e9cologique et technologique qui est en train de changer durablement le visage de la fili\u00e8re dans la r\u00e9gion.\u00a0 L'enjeu est\u00a0double : atteindre la neutralit\u00e9 carbone en 2050 et repenser la place de l'automobile dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \"Dans son objectif de r\u00e9duire de 55% les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre en 2030,\u00a0l'Union europ\u00e9enne a annonc\u00e9 la fin de la vente des v\u00e9hicules essence et diesel en 2035.

Mais passer du moteur thermique \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectrique ou \u00e0 l'hydrog\u00e8ne n'est pas sans cons\u00e9quence sur l'activit\u00e9 et la main d'\u0153uvre de la fili\u00e8re.\u00a0La r\u00e9gion a perdu 10% de ses effectifs en cinq ans Secteur\u00a0industriel historique de Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, l'automobile repr\u00e9sente 27% de l'emploi\u00a0industriel et 4% de l'emploi salari\u00e9 de la r\u00e9gion avec 42.340 salari\u00e9s. Cette derni\u00e8re n'\u00e9chappe donc pas \u00e0 cette transformation. \"La construction d'un v\u00e9hicule \u00e9lectrique n\u00e9cessite quatre fois moins de pi\u00e8ces en acier. Elle n\u00e9cessite donc\u00a0moins de personnels.\" R\u00e9sultat, une r\u00e9cente \u00e9tude de l'Insee montre que le secteur automobile en Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9 a perdu 10% de ses effectifs en cinq ans. Le nombre monte m\u00eame \u00e0 20% pour la seule construction automobile. Avec ces chiffres, la Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9 quitte le podium des r\u00e9gions comptant le plus de salari\u00e9s\u00a0dans cette activit\u00e9. Elle est d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par la r\u00e9gion Haut-de-France. \"Il faut toutefois nuancer car si on met ces chiffres au regard de la population, la Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9 reste sur la premi\u00e8re marche\", explique Florent Ovieve. En revanche, il est ind\u00e9niable que la r\u00e9gion est en baisse d'effectif\".\u00a0 Mannesmann Pr\u00e9cision tubes\u00a0\u00e0 Saint-Florentin, Valeo Vision \u00e0 Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Laurent Retread \u00e0 Avallon ou encore Mouvex \u00e0 Auxerre. Dans l'Yonne, les entreprises de sous-traitance qui travaillent pour le secteur automobile sont nombreuses. Ce sont aussi celles qui subissent les plus fortes perturbations du secteur. \"Les\u00a0entreprises sous-traitantes, celles qui fabriquent notamment les\u00a0pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9tach\u00e9es, sont celles sui sont le plus impact\u00e9s par la conjoncture et le passage du thermique \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectrique\", affirme Florent Ovieve.Des m\u00e9tiers en tension \u00c0 l'image de Benteler\u00a0\u00e0 Migennes, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans l'emboutissage \u00e0 chaud de pi\u00e8ces de moteurs et de ch\u00e2ssis, ou encore de\u00a0Marelli Automotive Lighting \u00e0 Saint-Julien du Sault,\u00a0sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la fabrication de feux arri\u00e8re des v\u00e9hicules. D\u00e9ficitaires, les deux entreprises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contraintes de fermer leur porte.

Contify.com(Document AUTONW0020240527ek5n00008) \r\n                        Valeo and Smovengo collaborate to remanufacture motors and batteries of 8,000 electric V\u00e9lib bicycles in Greater Paris. Valeo offers a range of solutions for small mobility devices like bicycles and scooters. Valeos circular economy strategy aims to extend the lifespan of existing mobility systems. Key Highlights: * Valeo has expertise in remanufacturing original parts for over 40 years. * Valeo has two sites specializing in remanufacturing: Circular Electronics Lab in Nevers and Circular Innovation Factory in Czechowice. * Smovengo repairs 1,000 bikes daily to ensure fleet availability 24/7. Original Press Release: May 23 -- Valeo\u00a0issued the following news release: \r\n                     Valeo and Smovengo, the operator of V\u00e9lib' M\u00e9tropole, a large-scale public bicycle sharing system in Paris and 64 of its communes, have joined forces to remanufacture the motors and batteries of the 8,000 electric V\u00e9lib' bicycles that tour the streets of Greater Paris. \r\n                     Valeo and remanufacturing for all mobilities \r\n                     Valeo is the keytechnology partner of global automakers and plays a major role in promoting more diverse mobility. Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for mobility in today\u2019s urban environments, Valeo offers a range of solutions for small mobility devices such as bicycles, scooters and electric rickshaws. \r\n                     Valeo\u2019s commitment to the e-bike sector includes the supply of Valeo Cyclee\u2122 electric motors and the circular maintenance of other essential components used in e-bikes such as the Smovengo bikes. Bringing such service for eBike is fully part of Valeo\u2019s circular economy strategy (4R) to expand the lifespan of existing mobility systems. This concrete action is possible thanks to Valeo\u2019s unique positioning to build the sustainable mobility of tomorrow. For over 40 years, Valeo has put its expertise in the design and manufacture of original parts at the service of remanufacturing, to offer a range of products with the highest quality standards. Two Valeo sites specialising in remanufacturing have been selected for the partnership with Smovengo: * the \u201cCircular Electronics Laboratory\u201d in Nevers for batteries \r\n                     Valeo launched in 2023 the Circular Electronics Lab in Nevers (France) to set up a dedicated team combining flexibility, quality and competitiveness, in touch with our internal experts to incubate circular electronics projects. This unit successfully launched the first ever remanufactured front camera and has expanded its circular services for Small Mobility, starting with the Repair of batteries for Smovengo. * the \u201cCircular Innovation Factory\u201d in Czechowice (Poland ) for electric motors Czechowice is Valeo\u2019s Competence Centre for remanufactured products such as starters, alternators, dual mass flywheels, dual clutches and air conditioning compressors, and is now expanding its remanufacturing activity into the field of micromobility with the motors equipped on Smovengo\u2019s electric bikes. Recycling and upgrading at the heart of Smovengo\u2019s commitments Since becoming the operator of V\u00e9lib\u2019 M\u00e9tropole in 2018, the largest station-based bike-sharing service in the world, covering 65 municipalities and 450 km2, Smovengo has been tackling a considerable logistical challenge. Every day, the teams in the field and in the workshops repair 1,000 bikes to ensure a constant availability of the fleet, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. To meet this challenge, and in response to the ecological emergency, Smovengo has chosen to strengthen its commitment to the circular economy by designing parts that are increasingly durable, reliable and, above all, refurbishable. This effort, steered by the R&D department, enables the provision of cutting-edge equipment while reducing dependence on Asian suppliers. Since 2020, the company has implemented a complete industrial process for recycling spare parts. All maintenance parts are prepared for a second life or recycled. Currently, 30 employees are dedicated daily to testing and repairing these components. In parallel, a wheel production line has been set up in Alfortville, producing the 2,500 wheels needed for fleet maintenance each week, using new or recycled parts. Continuing these efforts, Smovengo has been certified as a bicycle manufacturer in October 2021, allowing for the annual production of over 2,000 CE-certified electric and mechanical bicycles, also using new and recycled parts. To go further, and in order to repair more complex parts such as electric motors and batteries, specific expertise was needed, as well as industrialisation capacity. This is why Smovengo has entered into a partnership with Valeo, a global expert in automotive parts recycling. Eric Schuler, CEO of Valeo Service: \u201cValeo is delighted to announce its partnership with Smovengo, a major player in urban mobility in Paris. This collaboration for the repair and remanufacturing of batteries and motors for electric Velib bicycles demonstrates Valeo\u2019s commitment to safer and more sustainable mobility, and its capability to offer solutions for the electrification of all forms of mobility.\u201c \u201cAs a player in sustainable daily mobility, it is essential to provide responsible solutions to the environmental challenge,\u201d explains Jacques Greiveldinger, Managing Director of Smovengo. \u201cWe are proud of our partnership with Valeo, whose expertise helps us make significant progress in our commitments and continuously improve the management of second-hand parts in the bicycle sector. This represents a triple benefit: ecological, economic and optimisation of logistics for our company. The revaluation of motors and batteries is only the first step in this partnership, which will be extended to many other bicycle parts.\u201c About Smovengo A French company created in 2017, Smovengo has been the operator of V\u00e9lib\u2019 M\u00e9tropole since 1 January 2018. To maintain and regulate the world\u2019s largest public service of shared, rechargeable electric and mechanical bicycles in stations, Smovengo relies on employees and suppliers who are experts in cycling and logistics. As part of its mission, Smovengo is committed to social reintegration through employment and ongoing training for its employees, and to sharing knowledge and values. Convinced that soft mobility is the future of urban transport, Smovengo promotes sustainable and responsible production through essentially French design and manufacture, the use of 100% green energy and agenuine cycle of bicycle reuse and recycling.

Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s.(Document LEMFR00020240527ek5r0012x) La marque aux chevrons compte sur la nouvelle version de son petit best-seller (fabriqu\u00e9 en Slovaquie et propos\u00e9e \u00e0 prix tr\u00e8s serr\u00e9s) pour contrer le recul de ses parts de march\u00e9 en France et en Europe. Il est un terme qu\u2019il faut manier avec des pincettes, voire proscrire, si l\u2019on veut \u00e9viter de froisser la susceptibilit\u00e9 des dirigeants de Citro\u00ebn. Assimiler de pr\u00e8s ou de loin \u00e0 une conversion au mod\u00e8le \u00ab low cost \u00bb la nouvelle orientation de la marque qui entend vendre des voitures bon march\u00e9 \u00e0 la conception simplifi\u00e9e, suscite sur le champ une mise au point polie mais ferme. Pour r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de production, le constructeur pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9voquer le recours \u00e0 de sibyllines \u00ab \u00e9conomies intelligentes \u00bb. Nuance. Si on les pousse dans leurs retranchements, les repr\u00e9sentants de la firme aux chevrons admettent, mais du bout des l\u00e8vres, que Citro\u00ebn se place dor\u00e9navant en concurrent direct de Dacia. La marque du groupe Renault qui a port\u00e9 sur les fonts baptismaux et avec le succ\u00e8s que l\u2019on sait l\u2019automobile hyper-rationalis\u00e9e et pas ch\u00e8re. La nouvelle C3 ne veut pas \u00eatre estampill\u00e9e v\u00e9hicule \u00ab \u00e0 bas co\u00fbts \u00bb mais elle s\u2019en inspire sans ambages. Ce mod\u00e8le urbain qui a pouss\u00e9 en hauteur pour ressembler \u00e0 un petit SUV a taill\u00e9 dans ses tarifs. Il sera commercialis\u00e9 cet \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de 14 990 euros, soit 2 000 euros de moins que l\u2019ancien mod\u00e8le mais avec un moteur de 100 ch, plus puissant. C\u2019est \u00e0 peu de choses pr\u00e8s la facture pour une Dacia Sandero d\u2019entr\u00e9e de gamme. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, la \u00eb-C3 \u00e9lectrique a d\u00e9j\u00e0 annonc\u00e9 un prix-canon de 23 300 euros auquel il faut retrancher 4 000 euros au titre du bonus \u00e9cologique. Ces arguments sonnants et tr\u00e9buchants sont indispensables pour mener \u00e0 bien la double mission confi\u00e9e \u00e0 ce mod\u00e8le \u00e0 forts enjeux. D\u00e9mocratiser l\u2019automobile et sortir Citro\u00ebn d\u2019une position devenue tr\u00e8s inconfortable. 12 000 commandes Pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sans complexe par ses concepteurs comme \u00ab la meilleure offre du march\u00e9 \u00bb et la premi\u00e8re voiture aussi peu ch\u00e8re produite en Europe (les C3 sortent de l\u2019usine de Trnava, en Slovaquie) la \u00eb-C3 veut rendre accessibles les voitures \u00e9lectriques dont l\u2019offre est jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent domin\u00e9e par des v\u00e9hicules hors de port\u00e9e du plus grand nombre. Son prix d\u2019acc\u00e8s se situe encore au-dessus de son homologue thermique mais l\u2019\u00e9cart se r\u00e9duit avec les v\u00e9hicules conventionnels. Citro\u00ebn assure avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 enregistr\u00e9 12 000 commandes dont pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 par l\u2019entremise de la formule de leasing social lanc\u00e9e fin 2023 par le gouvernement afin d\u2019\u00e9largir la client\u00e8le des voitures \u00e9lectriques. La d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9server l\u2019attribution du bonus aux seuls mod\u00e8les fabriqu\u00e9s en Europe a aussi offert un joli coup de pouce \u00e0 la petite Citro\u00ebn face \u00e0 la Dacia Spring, sa principale concurrente, d\u00e9sormais priv\u00e9e de toute subvention. Equip\u00e9e d\u2019une batterie d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 de 44 kWh fournie par le chinois CATL et recourant \u00e0 la chimie lithium-fer-phosphate (LFP), moins performante mais moins ch\u00e8re d\u2019environ 25 % par rapport \u00e0 la technologie nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), la \u00eb-C3 revendique une autonomie maximale de 320 kilom\u00e8tres. Une donn\u00e9e qui lui permet de ne pas \u00eatre cantonn\u00e9e au r\u00f4le de deuxi\u00e8me voiture du foyer et d\u2019envisager des trajets au long cours, d\u2019autant que sa puissance de charge (100 kW en courant continu) lui ouvre l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux bornes de forte puissance du r\u00e9seau autoroutier. En 2025 il est pr\u00e9vu de lancer une variante \u00e0 19 900 euros \u00e9quip\u00e9e d\u2019une batterie de moindre capacit\u00e9 dont l\u2019autonomie sera ramen\u00e9e \u00e0 200 km. Sortir de l\u2019impasse Si la C3 pratique des tarifs aussi agressifs en mode \u00e9lectrique comme thermique c\u2019est qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue comme les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes Citro\u00ebn. Dessin\u00e9e tout en verticalit\u00e9 pour appara\u00eetre solide et rassurante, elle s\u2019inscrit \u00e0 rebours de la sophistication \u00e0 outrance et de l\u2019inflation tarifaire qui caract\u00e9risent l\u2019automobile des ann\u00e9es 2020. Cette voiture repose sur une plate-forme conventionnelle modifi\u00e9e pour le march\u00e9 indien et retravaill\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences europ\u00e9ennes qui n\u2019offre pas un \u00ab toucher de route \u00bb tr\u00e8s raffin\u00e9 mais ne sacrifie pas le confort. L\u2019habitacle, bien con\u00e7u, ne donne pas l\u2019impression d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie. Pour co\u00fbter moins cher \u00e0 produire, le nombre de pi\u00e8ces de carrosserie de la C3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit, les formes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 simplifi\u00e9es, quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments esth\u00e9tiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sacrifi\u00e9s (pas d\u2019antenne-requin sur le toit, des poign\u00e9es noires laqu\u00e9es sur toutes les versions) et seuls deux niveaux de finition sont propos\u00e9s. Point de toit-ouvrant ou de climatisation bi-zone et il faudra faire avec une tr\u00e8s ordinaire cl\u00e9 de contact plut\u00f4t qu\u2019avec un syst\u00e8me de d\u00e9marrage \u00ab mains libres \u00bb. In fine, cette approche inspir\u00e9e de la m\u00e9thode Dacia et qui sera reconduite pour les prochains mod\u00e8les Citro\u00ebn aura permis de r\u00e9duire de pr\u00e8s de 20 % les co\u00fbts de fabrication. En allant chasser sur des terres nouvelles, la C3 doit sortir de l\u2019impasse une marque dont elle repr\u00e9sentait la moiti\u00e9 des immatriculations en Europe au premier trimestre. En France, doubl\u00e9e par Dacia, Citro\u00ebn a recul\u00e9 \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me place du classement et ne p\u00e8se plus que 6 % des immatriculations soit une chute de huit points depuis 2010. En Europe, les ventes atteignent difficilement la barre des 4 % et les parts de march\u00e9 ont fondu de moiti\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame temps. Et le rappel en cours de 500 000 anciennes C3 produites entre 2009 et 2019 pour cause d\u2019airbags d\u00e9fectueux risque de ne pas arranger l\u2019image de la marque. Impos\u00e9 par le vieillissement d\u2019une gamme qui compte trop de mod\u00e8les sans grand relief et r\u00e9siste difficilement \u00e0 la concurrence, le choix strat\u00e9gique op\u00e9r\u00e9 par Citro\u00ebn doit permettre de donner plus de consistance \u00e0 la vocation de \u00ab marque populaire \u00bb que revendiquait jusqu\u2019alors le constructeur sans oser en assumer les cons\u00e9quences en terme de prix et de conception de ses mod\u00e8les. Un embarras paradoxal de la part d\u2019une marque qui a invent\u00e9 la 2 CV, v\u00e9hicule low-cost par excellence.",

He outlines the strategy in the light commercial vehicles (LCV) category and talks about Switch Mobility\u2019s funding. Edited excerpts: Your goal is to enter the top 10 global CV manufacturers in the future. What will be the role of exports? Around 15 years ago, we only had two buses that were our mainstay for exports. Today, we have a strong portfolio, ranging from buses to trucks. We never used to have left-hand drive trucks. This strong product base allows us entry into several overseas markets. Today, the Gulf Cooperation Council has come to accept Ashok Leyland as a trusted brand. I think the West Asian market remains strong. The SAARC market is reviving once again. In Africa, although we are not present in 15 countries, it keeps oscillating. We are looking to enter Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. When we look at the vision, we are clear that when we come to the top 10, we know what we need to do, like the share in the domestic market in Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles, Heavy Commercial Vehicles, and international operations. We have more products lined up catering to international operations and are moving towards products for the West Asian and European markets. \r\n                     Ashok Leyland is unveiling six launches in the LCV segment this year. What are the reasons for this push, when rural demand is not that high? Till 2011, we were not in the LCV segment. Over the past 12 to 13 years, we have given a big push. Our initial launches were in collaboration with Nissan. Once we were comfortable with it, we realised that we need to invest on our own. Our collaboration with Nissan ended, and we launched Bada Dost, which helped us boost our market share. In the 2-3.5 tonne segment, we now have a market share of 20 per cent and there is a growth opportunity we are seeing in the distribution network with logistics and e-commerce companies. \r\n                     Ashok Leyland launched e-LCVs in March. You have seen advance interest for 13,000 units from various firms. How do you see the response you are getting? It is only in April that we have sold around 60-80 vehicles. The order book is continuing to grow. Whoever is testing the vehicle is giving us a good response. A disadvantage is that FAME subsidies were withdrawn. The government is speaking about FAME-III, if that comes back, then this will accelerate. It has slowed down the push to the volumes. Wherever the government has provided incentives for the purchase of two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars, buses, and trucks, it gets a push for most of these alternate fuels. Without it (incentives), people will not see the reason why they should do this. From the automobile sector, what will be your wish list for the new government? From the government side, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, and look at trucks as well. Other automotive bodies are saying that when we are considering these incentives, we So far, the incentives are predominantly for buses in the commercial vehicle segment space, and will be good if they can implement it in the truck segment as well. You were looking for a strategic partner in Switch Mobility. What is the status? The enthusiasm regarding electric vehicles is not prevalent on a global basis. Even in the discussions that we were having, we did not feel that valuations were correct. Today, Ashok Leyland is in a strong position with its financials. We don't feel it is necessary to give equity to anyone at a valuation that does not justify the right value. We will continue to invest for the time being in Switch Mobility. You are entering the 15th year as \r\n                     Ashok Leyland chairman. How do you look back at the journey so far? I have been associated with Ashok Leyland for 30 years. But the growth is driven by the team. Whether it is the subsequent managing directors who have been there, the greatest strength of Ashok Leyland more than its products is its team. We have seen solid growth. From 2010-11, we started light commercial vehicles. It was in 2007-08 that we started building our engines and have grown from strength to strength. We have ramped up our product development capabilities, our network, the international operations, and have a clear vision on what we are driving towards. The best thing is that it is no longer the board setting targets about the market share. It\u2019s now been done by the team. When the team is doing it, I would say that the majority of the battle is won.",

All Rights Reserved.(Document ENPNEW0020240527ek5r000k5) Release date - 24052024 Auburn Hills, Mich. - With the rebirth of the custom-built 33 Stradale, Alfa Romeo's new limited-edition supercar follows in the footsteps of the 1960s icon and one of the most beautiful cars of all time - the Tipo 33. * Texan and entrepreneur Glynn Bloomquist, one of the 33 passionate owners of the new Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale, recently visited the Alfa Romeo History Museum in Arese for an immersive brand experience * Reveling in 'Bottega Alfa Romeo,' Bloomquist finalized exclusive features of his car, including: * Rosso Villa d'Este multilayer exterior paint with a white stripe on the front * No. 14 on the sides, in homage to his two favorite drivers Enzo Ferrari and A.J. Foyt * As a true Alfista, Bloomquist intends to fully experience the pure emotional thrill only an Alfa Romeo can convey on the track and along roads in his home state of Texas * New Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale is a result of skillfully combining artisan processes, technological innovation and customer specifications * The 33 Stradale builds serve as an authentic 'manifesto' of the Italian brand's capabilities - now and in the future - in terms of style and driving experience Fittingly, the new Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale will be offered in only 33 personally specified units. Among the exclusive customers is American Glynn Bloomquist of Texas. 'I was born in a hospital on an Air Force base, maybe that's where my love of speed and maximum performance comes from,' said Bloomquist while introducing himself a few weeks ago to the Alfa Romeo team in Italy, where he finalized in person the one-off configuration of his Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale. The meeting took place at the Alfa Romeo Museum in Arese, an iconic location where some of the most beautiful cars in the world are kept, including the fascinating historic 33 Stradale that inspired the new custom-built car. After an exclusive visit to the museum, the Alfa Romeo team welcomed Mr. Bloomquist to the Sala del Consiglio of the Museum in Arese, where the design of the 33 Stradale was approved in 1967, now the Bottega Alfa Romeo's headquarters. In this symbolic place, the brand's designers, engineers and historians met and listened to the 33 owners, then created alongside them what have become unique works of art and an authentic 'manifesto' of the Italian brand's capabilities - now and in the future - in terms of style and driving experience. 'Alfa Romeo created the new 33 Stradale, a tribute to the legendary 1967 original, for the most passionate of Alfisti around the world, including right here in America,' said Larry Dominique, SVP, head of Alfa Romeo North America. 'A true Alfista, Glynn Bloomquist will be representing the Alfa Romeo brand in the most fitting way, by driving his 33 Stradale in the Lone Star state, on both streets and racetracks, to experience the visceral thrill that only a 620-horspower mid-engine Alfa Romeo supercar can deliver.' With a production run of 33 exclusive units, the new two-seat coupe combines heritage and the future, and is produced according to a unique artisanal process with the highest quality standards and attention to detail, similar to workshops of renowned Italian coachbuilders in the 1960s. One of these was Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, which left its mark on some of the most beautiful Alfa Romeos of all time and now plays a leading role in the production of the new 33 Stradale. Passion for American racing and discovery of Italian motorsport Growing up with a father who was passionate about American racing and muscle cars, Glynn Bloomquist quickly fell in love with U.S. motorsports, a passion that soon saw him move to Indianapolis for work, where his photography company sponsored the legendary Indianapolis 500, the greatest championship for open-wheel cars in the U.S. 'I spent 10 years traveling the world sponsoring IndyCar,' said Bloomquist. 'Some of my fondest memories of that time are of our first driver, Jimmy Vasser. In 1992 as a rookie, he climbed the podium at Indianapolis after setting the speed record for a rookie in Indy 500 history: over 222 mph.' Building on these experiences in racing, Bloomquist began to shift his focus abroad to discover the sporting heritage of European brands, especially in Italy. The ones that impressed him the most were Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, two brands unique in the world for their sporting history, made-in-Italy design and cutting-edge technology. Reading a book about Enzo Ferrari, Bloomquist discovered the unbreakable bond between the renowned entrepreneur and the Alfa Romeo brand, a 20-year relationship during which Enzo Ferrari acted as tester, driver, commercial collaborator and, finally, director of the legendary Alfa Romeo racing department. From that moment on, Bloomquist's interest in Italian motorsports evolved into a true passion that resulted in his purchase of Italian cars. A recent addition to his collection is a magnificent Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio 100th Anniversary edition, which he had the privilege of driving on the F1 track at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, as the Alfa Romeo team's guest in 2023. That was when he met Cristiano Fiorio, head of the 33 Stradale project, who offered him the opportunity of a lifetime. 'It didn't take me long to accept the idea of becoming one of the 33 customers of the new Alfa Romeo custom-built car, as long as it was red and red alone,' said Bloomquist with a smile. Fiorio himself recounts, 'from the first time we met in Austin, we had a special relationship with Glynn. The human engagement he brought to the project, and the passion in his and the team's approach to the configuration process are truly something unique. No less unique is the wonderful model he has passionately configured for the brand and for the history of world motorsports.' Configuration inspired by its forerunner with a contemporary flair As per his request, Bloomquist's new 33 Stradale sports a multilayer Rosso Villa d'Este livery embellished with a horizontal white band in the front, quite a rare design element in supercars. It revisits, with a contemporary flair, the red and white color combination of the Tipo 33, a 1960s motorsports legend and forerunner of the 1967 33 Stradale. Likewise, he decided on the location of the legendary Quadrifoglio and Autodelta logos, on special rear air intakes, as well as the design of the new 20-inch 'Progressive' alloy wheels in black with carbon-fiber inserts. With one eye on the iconic 1967 33 Stradale on display at the Arese Museum, for the interior Bloomquist opted for the Tributo configuration in two-tone slate and biscuit with trim in aluminum, adding slate Alcantara upholstery for the dashboard and part of the seats, door panels and central tunnel, combined with a specific, very fine biscuit-colored leather. The Texan also requested the inclusion of the No. 14 on the outside of the doors and in the interior embroidered on the headrests in homage to two exceptional drivers who used it on their racecars: Enzo Ferrari on his 1920s Alfa Romeo and A.J. Foyt on his Foyt Coyote. Choosing the number 14 is a tribute to Alfa Romeo's sporting heritage and to the legendary American racer who won the Indianapolis 500 four times and USAC championship seven times. In short, the configuration of Bloomquist's 33 Stradale is a veritable handbook of Italian and U.S. automotive sportiness. 'I can't wait to get my hands on the steering wheel of my 33 Stradale and hear the sound of its 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine with over 620 horsepower,' said Bloomquist. 'Of course, it won't stay sitting in the garage. In and around central Texas, where I live, there are plenty of fantastic streets and circuits where I track all my cars, and my Alfa Romeo custom build will be no exception.' Alfa Romeo Born in 1910 in Milan, Italy, Alfa Romeo has designed and crafted some of the most stylish and sporty cars in automotive history. That tradition lives on today as Alfa Romeo continues to take a unique and innovative approach to automobiles. The Alfa Romeo Stelvio sets a benchmark in performance, style and technology in an SUV. The award-winning Alfa Romeo Giulia delivers race-inspired performance, advanced technologies and an exhilarating driving experience to the premium midsize sedan segment. In early 2023, Alfa Romeo will offer its first compact SUV with the all-new Tonale. The globally available Tonale is part of a radical evolution taking place at Alfa Romeo, which looks ahead to a new era of electrification and connectivity. Alfa Romeo is part of the portfolio of brands offered by leading global automaker and mobility provider Stellantis.

Un ralentissement qui pousse certains constructeurs \u00e0 affiner leurs strat\u00e9gies \u00c9TIENNE MEYER-VACHERAND @etiennemeyva Apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es de croissance constante, les ventes de voitures \u00e9lectriques connaissent un ralentissement continu au niveau europ\u00e9en. Amorc\u00e9 fin 2023, ce mouvement s\u2019est confirm\u00e9 lors des premiers mois de cette ann\u00e9e. Le nombre de nouveaux v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques continue n\u00e9anmoins de progresser mais \u00e0 un rythme moins soutenu que les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. De janvier \u00e0 avril, 441 992 nouvelles voitures \u00e9lectriques \u00e0 batterie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es selon les chiffres de l\u2019Association des constructeurs europ\u00e9ens d\u2019automobiles (ACEA), soit une augmentation de 6,4% par rapport \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en 2023. Leur part de march\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 12% en avril contre une moyenne de 14,6% l\u2019an pass\u00e9. \u00abCe ralentissement est surprenant au niveau de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, puisque la fin des ventes de voitures thermiques est toujours pr\u00e9vue pour 2035. On aurait donc pu s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une croissance continue\u00bb, rel\u00e8ve Baptiste Leflaive du cabinet de conseil Colombus Consulting. Le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne s\u2019observe aussi en Suisse. En avril, Auto-Suisse, l\u2019association regroupant les importateurs officiels d\u2019automobiles, indique que les nouvelles immatriculations font du surplace \u00e0 13 603 (+0,2%) sur les quatre premiers mois. \u00abCette tendance s\u2019inscrit dans un ralentissement g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 des ventes de voitures, mais les pure player \u00e9lectriques comme Tesla ou BYD sont particuli\u00e8rement touch\u00e9s\u00bb, souligne d\u2019embl\u00e9e Arnaud Aym\u00e9, sp\u00e9cialiste des transports pour le cabinet Sia Partners. Au premier trimestre, la plupart des grands constructeurs affichent des chiffres en recul. Le groupe Stellantis a vu ses livraisons baisser de 10% \u00e0 1 335 000 v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle mondiale. Chez Volkswagen, les ventes reculaient de 2% par rapport au premier trimestre 2023. Tandis que Tesla a vu ses livraisons \u00e0 travers le monde chuter de 8,5%. Au-del\u00e0 de la tendance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, plusieurs ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes expliquent le ralentissement des ventes de voitures \u00e9lectriques. \u00abLorsque la voiture \u00e9lectrique repr\u00e9sentait 2% des parts de march\u00e9, les acheteurs \u00e9taient des personnes pour qui ces v\u00e9hicules r\u00e9pondaient parfaitement \u00e0 leurs besoins en termes d\u2019autonomie et de praticit\u00e9. Plus le march\u00e9 s\u2019est \u00e9largi, plus il a fallu aller chercher des clients pour qui ces v\u00e9hicules sont moins adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs usages\u00bb, estime Flavien Neuvy, \u00e9conomiste et directeur de l\u2019Observatoire Cetelem, organisme d\u2019\u00e9tudes et de veille \u00e9conomique de BNP Paribas Personnal Finance. Prix \u00e9lev\u00e9s, \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 en hausse et aides en baisse L\u2019autonomie et la question des bornes de recharge restent des freins \u00e0 l\u2019achat. Mais s\u2019y sont ajout\u00e9es les hausses des prix de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui ont diminu\u00e9 l\u2019attrait des voitures \u00e9lectriques, plus ch\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019achat, par rapport aux thermiques. \u00abPlus l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est ch\u00e8re, plus il faut rouler pour compenser le surco\u00fbt d\u2019une voiture \u00e9lectrique\u00bb, r\u00e9sume le sp\u00e9cialiste. Une situation qui pousse les consommateurs cherchant \u00e0 changer de voiture, \u00e0 repousser son remplacement estime Arnaud Aym\u00e9, d\u2019autant que les prix des voitures ont consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. En janvier, la plateforme AutoScout24 indiquait avoir constat\u00e9 une hausse des prix des voitures neuves de 5% en 2023. Et ces \u00e9volutions s\u2019accompagnent d\u2019une diminution des soutiens gouvernementaux \u00e0 l\u2019achat dans plusieurs pays. En Allemagne, les aides pour l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une voiture \u00e9lectrique ou l\u2019installation d\u2019une borne a domicile ont \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9es en d\u00e9cembre. La France a, elle, durci les conditions d\u2019acc\u00e8s au bonus \u00e9cologique en d\u00e9but d\u2019ann\u00e9e excluant par exemple les voitures trop lourdes. Les voitures dont la production \u00e9met trop de CO2 sont \u00e9galement exclues. \u00abC\u2019est une mani\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9carter les voitures produites en Chine, qu\u2019elles soient de marques chinoises ou non, du fait du poids du charbon dans la production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui alimente les usines dans le pays\u00bb, pointe Arnaud Aym\u00e9. Cette suppression des aides intervient alors, que l\u2019industrie automobile et les autorit\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes ne cessent d\u2019exprimer leurs craintes de voir des voitures \u00e9lectriques chinoises bon march\u00e9 inonder le march\u00e9. \u00abEn Suisse aussi les v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques sont d\u00e9sormais tax\u00e9s comme les autres, rappelle Baptiste Leflaive. Le choix est laiss\u00e9 au consommateur par la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration d\u2019acheter un v\u00e9hicule produit plus localement mais plus cher, o\u00f9 une voiture plus abordable produite en Chine.\u00bb \r\n                     Stellantis vendra des voitures chinoises Pour autant, de l\u2019avis de ces experts, les constructeurs europ\u00e9ens ont les reins assez solides pour encaisser ce ralentissement et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la concurrence chinoise. En revanche, chez les jeunes constructeurs purement investis dans l\u2019\u00e9lectrique, la situation pourrait faire des victimes. D\u00e9but mai, l\u2019am\u00e9ricain Fisker, quasiment en faillite, annon\u00e7ait l\u2019arr\u00eat de la production de son SUV \u00e9lectrique. Pour contrer l\u2019\u00e9rosion des ventes et la concurrence chinoise, Tesla a drastiquement baiss\u00e9 ses tarifs. Pour Baptiste Leflaive, les constructeurs historiques doivent veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un \u00e9cart entre l\u2019offre et la demande ne se cr\u00e9e pas: \u00abSi on veut que ce ralentissement ne dure pas, les constructeurs doivent revenir \u00e0 une offre plus simple. Les clients cherchent aujourd\u2019hui surtout des voitures de type citadin. La promesse de nombreux \u00e9quipements technologiques n\u2019est plus un argument de vente\u00bb, affirme-t-il. La situation provoque d\u00e9j\u00e0 des ajustements de strat\u00e9gie. Hier, le groupe allemand Volkswagen a annonc\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation en 2027 d\u2019un mod\u00e8le grand public \u00e0 environ 20 000 euros. Face \u00e0 la concurrence chinoise, Stellantis a annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait commercialiser les voitures \u00e9lectriques de son partenaire chinois Leapmotor en Europe d\u00e8s septembre. Mercedes qui annon\u00e7ait vouloir atteindre les 100% de v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques dans sa gamme d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030 a revu cette proportion \u00e0 50% et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de repousser l\u2019\u00e9lectrification de ses mod\u00e8les haut de gamme. \u00abDes constructeurs comme Mercedes sont pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l\u2019international. En dehors de la Chine et de l\u2019Europe, les autres march\u00e9s sont loin de prendre la direction de l\u2019\u00e9lectrique. C\u2019est une mani\u00e8re de temporiser et de satisfaire tous les march\u00e9s, mais l\u2019histoire est en marche et ce n\u2019est pas viable pour un constructeur de maintenir, \u00e0 terme, deux lignes de production en parall\u00e8le\u00bb, d\u00e9taille Arnaud Aym\u00e9. Ces strat\u00e9gies s\u2019inscrivent aussi dans un contexte \u00e9lectoral rappelle Flavien Neuvy: \u00abIl ne faut pas oublier que ce que la politique a fait, la politique peut le d\u00e9faire. Actuellement la fin des ventes de voitures thermiques est act\u00e9e pour 2035, mais nous sommes \u00e0 la veille d\u2019une \u00e9lection europ\u00e9enne o\u00f9 des partis populistes oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectrification sont en bonnes positions et certains pays membre de l\u2019UE remettent en cause cette strat\u00e9gie.\u00bb Des voitures \u00e9lectriques destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019exportation empil\u00e9es au terminal international de conteneurs du port de Taicang. (SUZHOU, CHINE, 16 AVRIL 2024/STR/AFP) \u00abCe ralentissement est surprenant au niveau de l\u2019UE, puisque la fin des ventes de voitures thermiques est pr\u00e9vue pour 2035\u00bb BAPTISTE LEFLAIVE, CONSULTANT CHEZ COLOMBUS CONSULTING \u00abPlus l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est ch\u00e8re, plus il faut rouler pour compenser le surco\u00fbt d\u2019une voiture \u00e9lectrique\u00bb FLAVIEN NEUVY, DIRECTEUR DE L\u2019OBSERVATOIRE CETELEM ACC\u00c8S Sans bornes, pas de passage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectrique C\u2019est l\u2019un des freins \u00e0 l\u2019achat d\u2019une voiture \u00e9lectrique. Le manque de stations de recharge est identifi\u00e9 comme un probl\u00e8me central \u00e0 r\u00e9gler pour garantir une transition vers la mobilit\u00e9 \u00e9lectrique. L\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019installer une station \u00e0 domicile, la peur de ne pas trouver une borne sur son trajet, ou encore de se trouver face \u00e0 un point de charge en panne continuent de d\u00e9courager de potentiels acheteurs. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les estimations de la Commission europ\u00e9enne, 3,5 millions de bornes de recharge devraient \u00eatre install\u00e9es d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030. Un rythme qui correspond \u00e0 8000 bornes publiques par semaine alors qu\u2019en 2023, il \u00e9tait de 3000 par semaine. En fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e, l\u2019UE comptait 632 423 points de recharge publics. Mais selon l\u2019Association des constructeurs europ\u00e9ens d\u2019automobiles (ACEA), il faudrait en fait 8,8 millions de points de recharge d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030 pour remplir les objectifs de d\u00e9carbonation fix\u00e9s, soit plus de 22 000 installations par semaine. En Suisse, l\u2019Office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l\u2019\u00e9nergie (OFEN) table sur la mise en circulation de 2,8 millions de v\u00e9hicules rechargeables d\u2019ici \u00e0 2035, ce qui n\u00e9cessiterait l\u2019installation de 84 000 points de recharge en libre acc\u00e8s. En mars, on comptait 13 260 stations sur le territoire helv\u00e9tique. Mais malgr\u00e9 une acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration depuis f\u00e9vrier 2023, au rythme d\u2019installation moyen des douze derniers mois, l\u2019objectif ne sera pas atteint \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance pr\u00e9vue. Mais de plus en plus d\u2019acteurs se lancent sur le march\u00e9. Ce lundi, le fran\u00e7ais Elektra annon\u00e7ait l\u2019installation de sa premi\u00e8re station de charge rapide en Suisse et pr\u00e9voit d\u2019installer 100 sites suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019ici \u00e0 2026. Reste la probl\u00e9matique de la charge au domicile. Avec plus de 60% de locataires, la question de l\u2019installation d\u2019une station sur le lieu d\u2019habitation reste un probl\u00e8me. Contrairement \u00e0 certains pays comme la France, il n\u2019existe pas de \u00abdroit \u00e0 la prise\u00bb en Suisse, qui oblige le loueur \u00e0 installer ces \u00e9quipements si le locataire en fait la demande. En France, cette installation se fait aux frais du demandeur. En Suisse, une demande peut-\u00eatre faite au bailleur mais reste soumise \u00e0 sa volont\u00e9. L\u2019Association suisse pour l\u2019\u00e9lectromobilit\u00e9, Swiss eMobility, et l\u2019OFEN ont mis au point un guide donnant le cadre juridique et les prescriptions \u00e0 respecter en Suisse, ainsi que les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une infrastructure de recharge durable et adapt\u00e9e aux immeubles locatifs.

Au total, 19 banques, dont 16 priv\u00e9es, se sont coalis\u00e9es pour l'op\u00e9ration. Cette fois, \u00e7a y est. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 lever 2 milliards d'euros en septembre (dont 850 millions en apport de capital), Verkor a enfin finalis\u00e9 le financement de sa gigafactory de batteries qu'il projette de construire \u00e0 Dunkerque. La jeune pousse grenobloise a s\u00e9curis\u00e9 1,1 milliard d'euros suppl\u00e9mentaires par le biais d'un \u00ab pr\u00eat vert \u00bb pour lequel se sont coalis\u00e9es 16 banques priv\u00e9es et trois banques publiques. Une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de signature s'est tenue \u00e0 Matignon en fin d'apr\u00e8s-midi en pr\u00e9sence de toutes les parties. Le tour de table inclut c\u00f4t\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais (par ordre alphab\u00e9tique) La Banque Postale, les Caisses d'Epargne Hauts-de-France et Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Natixis et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Parmi les enseignes \u00e9trang\u00e8res, ABN Amro ou encore Banco Santander sont \u00e9galement de la partie. La BEI en cl\u00e9 de vo\u00fbte Ces 16 banques apportent 961 millions de pr\u00eat senior, dont un peu plus d'un tiers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la garantie des projets strat\u00e9giques apport\u00e9e par l'Etat fran\u00e7ais. Un pr\u00eat de 150 millions accord\u00e9 par la Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts compl\u00e8te le dispositif. La Banque europ\u00e9enne d'investissement (BEI) joue \u00e9galement un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 avec une aide de 400 millions, dont 270 millions de pr\u00eat direct et 130 millions interm\u00e9di\u00e9s aux banques commerciales participantes.

L'assombrissement du climat \u00e9conomique en 2023, coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 la hausse des taux, a rendu les investisseurs tr\u00e8s prudents. \u00ab Quand il s'agit de financer une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans un nouveau m\u00e9tier, il faut n\u00e9cessairement rassurer, confirme-t-on du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Matignon. Sur ce point, l'action de l'Etat, qui a apport\u00e9 sa garantie sur 353 millions de pr\u00eat, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminante. \u00bb Le soutien de Renault, qui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour ses futurs v\u00e9hicules les trois quarts des 16 GWH que repr\u00e9sente la premi\u00e8re tranche de l'usine, a lui aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 essentiel. Selon Beno\u00eet Lemaignan, le coup de mou des ventes de v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques en Europe ces derniers mois, qui a amen\u00e9 certains constructeurs \u00e0 r\u00e9viser leurs plans d'investissement, n'a pas eu d'impact sur la derni\u00e8re ligne droite des discussions. \u00ab Il faut faire la diff\u00e9rence entre la vague et l'\u00e9cume de la vague. Personne ne conteste la tendance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u00bb A Dunkerque, le chantier de construction de la future usine est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours. Les premi\u00e8res machines doivent arriver dans les prochaines semaines. A Grenoble, les \u00e9quipes sont en train de se former au futur processus de production au sein du centre d'innovation de Verkor. La production des premi\u00e8res batteries dans la future gigafactory est annonc\u00e9e pour le second semestre 2025.

Benzinga.com(Document BNZNGA0020240527ek5r000mc) Automaker Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) is reportedly considering the production of two additional hybrid vehicles in Italy, a move seen as an attempt to placate local politicians while contemplating shifting some manufacturing to cheaper countries. What Happened: The automaker plans to manufacture hybrid versions of a Jeep model at the Melfi plant in southern Italy and the Fiat 500 at the Mirafiori facility in Turin, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The information comes from sources familiar with the matter. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares is set to present this proposal during a meeting with local unions in Turin on Monday. The initiative is part of Stellantis's strategy to increase its vehicle production in Italy to 1 million units by 2030, up from approximately 750,000 last year. \r\n                     Stellantis's plans hinge on the level of support from the Italian government and unions, the sources added. Discussions between the carmaker, the government, and local unions will continue following Monday's meeting. \r\n                     Stellantis is yet to respond to the queries sent by Benzinga. Earlier this month, Italy's financial police seized several Fiat Topolinos, claiming they displayed the national flag despite being assembled in Morocco. This incident is part of an ongoing conflict between the Italian government and Stellantis. See Also: Jeeps All-Electric Wagoneer S Beats Tesla Model Y Performance In Acceleration Test, Lags Behind Model X\n Thousands of Italians recently protested near Stellantis's Turin base, anticipating further job cuts. Meanwhile, the Italian government has been in talks with other carmakers, including Tesla, BYD, and Dongfeng Motor Group, about potential production opportunities in Italy. Why It Matters: The decision by Stellantis to expand hybrid vehicle production in Italy comes amid significant political and economic pressures. Earlier this year, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized Stellantis for shifting production abroad, raising concerns about job losses and economic impact. Additionally, Stellantis has been adapting to the electric vehicle (EV) challenge by cutting costs through global job shifts, following the lead of Tesla. The company's latest move to propose the production of new hybrid models in Italy is seen as an effort to balance these cost-cutting measures with the need to maintain domestic production and appease local stakeholders.

      "complete_entry": "Hyperactivity at Lexus: the Japanese brand unveils three new products in one day\n CE NoticiasFinancieras, Monday, 27  May 2024, 1140 Words, Copyright \u00a9 Content Engine LLC(Document NFINCE0020240527ek5r002b8) It is common for car brands to present new products on a regular basis. But finding three from the same manufacturer in a single day is not at all normal. However, Lexus has surprised with the presentation of different versions of three of its models. The first one is the NX Overtrail, a more camper variant of the Japanese SUV; the second, the LBX Match Point, a series limited to 25 units and inspired by the world of tennis; and, as a third, the expansion of the range of the electric RZ, with a new version equipped with front-wheel drive (FWD) and called RZ 300e. In the case of the NX Overtrail, this version incorporates a series of exterior aesthetic details that make it exclusive within its range. It offers a raised suspension with 15 millimeters more ground clearance, which brings the total height of the vehicle to 1,675 millimeters. Thus, the ground clearance now reaches 200 millimeters, so you can better cope with the most complicated roads. In addition, dynamic performance has been improved thanks to the addition of front and rear Perfomance Dampers. The exterior design incorporates elements in black finish, as in the exterior mirrors, door handles, wheel arches moldings and roof rails, as well as black metallic trim on the windows and matte black wheels. The front grille is more prominent, with a bright metal machined frame, and the alloy wheels are 18 inches and of new design, equipped with all-terrain tires. The interior features front sport seats upholstered in black Tahara leatherette with lumbar support and Khaki side bolsters. The door panels and glove box also incorporate the Khaki interior finish, with new Overtrail inserts with hardwood finish. It features an ambient lighting system, which provides indirect lighting in the footwell, door panels and center console, with 64 different colors to choose from. In addition, the NX Overtrail incorporates the air conditioning system with advanced air quality technology Nanoe-X, which launches trillions of tiny water molecules to the air conditioning system, thus fighting bacteria, viruses, mold and odors, while refreshing the hair and skin with a moisturizing effect, according to Lexus. This version is available in two colors, with an Olive Green shade and a metallic sand color Moon Desert, and black and Khaki interior with Overtrail inserts. It is associated with the self-recharging hybrid engine 2.5 L, which yields 244 hp of power and is associated with all-wheel drive (AWD), starting its price from 71,100 euros. This is the LBX Match Point A few days before the start of Roland Garros, Lexus has presented the LBX Match Point, a special series limited to 25 units that is inspired by the world of tennis, and was initially designed for the Trofeo Conde de Godo 2024. In fact, Lexus is currently Official Automotive Partner and Platinum Partner of the ATP Tour, the world's elite men's professional tennis circuit. The Japanese brand explains that the world of tennis and its colors are the protagonists of this special version of its smallest crossover. Therefore, there are aesthetic details in yellow, representing the characteristic tone of tennis balls, as in the front, the lower lip of the rear, the roof and rearview mirrors, on a body in a metallic Berlin Gray tone, topped laterally with the characteristic track lines in the decorative moldings of the C-pillar. The alloy wheels are 18 inches, with an exclusive design, and are finished in matte black with accents accented in yellow, on which you can read the name of the model. Inside, the connection to tennis is provided by leather seats upholstered in Caramel color, which play in a two-tone interior with side panels in black leather with yellow accented stitching, mats signed with the Match Point logo and an eye-catching start button. The 25 units will be available from October for 45,700 euros. RZ 300e, new electric version The batch of new products is completed with the new RZ 300e version, front-wheel drive (FWD), which extends the range of the RZ electric SUV, with deliveries scheduled from September and a price starting at 57,900 euros. This version represents a new entry point for the model, with a single electric motor located on the front axle, developing a power output of 150 kW (204 hp), with a maximum torque of 266 Nm. It accelerates from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in eight seconds. It has a lithium-ion battery of 71.4 kWh with a range in WLTP combined cycle of up to 480 kilometers, if we talk about the version equipped with 18-inch Aero EV design alloy wheels. When opting for the 20-inch Premium EV design alloy wheels, the official range drops to 419 kilometers. It should be recalled that in the all-wheel drive (AWD) versions, the range figures move between 395 and 440 kilometers. The new RZ 300e will be available in three trim levels called e-Business, e-Executive and e-Luxury, among which standard features include a heated steering wheel and heated front seats, the 12.3-inch Lexus Link Pro multimedia system with integrated premium navigation, dual-zone climate control with Nanoe X air purification technology, a dimmable panoramic roof (in the Luxury trim), a radiant heating system (Executive and Luxury), an electric tailgate (Executive and Luxury) and the Smart Entry hands-free access system. The Japanese firm's large electric SUV equips an extensive list of third-generation Lexus Safety System+ 3.0 safety assistants, such as the pre-collision safety system, with emergency power steering, and adaptive cruise control, as well as proactive power steering, for safer driving in urban traffic. Also present is a driver monitoring system, which constantly checks the driver's level of alertness, and gently stops the vehicle and activates the hazard lights if necessary. Meanwhile, Lexus' e-Latch electronic soft-opening system incorporates a Safe Exit Assist function, which automatically prevents a door from opening when a vehicle, bicycle or motorcycle approaches from behind. It's not uncommon for car brands to introduce new products on a regular basis. But to find three from the same manufacturer in a single day is not at all normal.

All rights reserved.(Document KORTIM0020240526ek5q00004) The new Renault Arkana SUV / Courtesy of Renault Korea By Lee Min-hyungThe new Renault Arkana hybrid SUV is gaining traction from customers for its strong fuel efficiency, as most customers still remain hesitant to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) due to the country's weak charging infrastructure. The strategic SUV from Renault Korea emerges as a major alternative for those who want fuel-efficient vehicles with reasonable prices. The new Arkana is capable of driving 17.4 kilometers per liter, powered by its E-Tech hybrid drive system. It features a 1.6-liter gasoline engine combined with two electric motors. Customers also displayed satisfaction with the vehicle's fuel efficiency. 'I drive about 20 kilometers daily for work on the weekdays and go on a long-distance trip on the weekends, but I visit a gas station every once or twice a month with the Arkana hybrid model,' an office worker in his 30s said. 'I used to fill up my previous gasoline-powered vehicle with fuel about four to five times a month, but the frequency halved after I purchased the Arkana.' Another Arkana owner also spoke highly of the decent fuel efficiency of the vehicle. 'The fuel efficiency of the vehicle sometimes rose to 25 kilometers per liter when I stayed on Jeju Island for about a month,' the owner said. 'I rarely feel a sense of financial burden while driving the vehicle, as it offers such a strong fuel efficiency.' Renault Korea picked the E-Tech hybrid technology as the key driving force for the performance. The vehicle is equipped with a 1.6-kilowatt per hour (kWh) battery, so more than 75 percent of its city drives are powered by its electric motors, according to the carmaker. The vehicle operates an EV mode during rush hour when it frequently decelerates and stops. When it picks up speed, the electric motors enable drivers to feel a sense of agility facilitated by the electric motors. The vehicle is also price competitive. The highest trim sells for 31.02 million won ($22,660) here. Its sleek coupe design and spacious interior are also two key upsides of the vehicle. Renault Korea equipped the vehicle with its famous diamond-shaped lozenge emblem. 'The new Arkana is the best option for customers who do not have any immediate plans to purchase EVs but place a top priority on fuel efficiency,' a Renault Korea official said. 'Arkana's refined design along with Renault's symbolic emblem added a more luxurious image to the vehicle.'",

All Rights Reserved.(Document LBA0000020240528ek5s02y91) PARIS, May 28 (Reuters) - French tyre maker Michelin said on Tuesday it was targeting a segment operating margin of 14% by 2026, citing sales of higher value-added tyres particularly for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and electric cars. It was more cautious about its diversification targets beyond tyres. The group, whose operating margin came to 12.6% in 2023, said at an investor day on Tuesday that a recovery in volumes, a strong product mix effect and growth in sales excluding tyres should enable it to achieve segment operating income of 4.2 billion euros ($4.57 billion) in 2026, compared with 3.6 billion last year. However, the group cut its targets for its non-tyre business. It now expects that its non-tyre business will account for more than 20% of total sales by 2030, versus 20% to 30% previously forecast. This target now includes tyre distribution alongside connected solutions, polymers and \"lifestyle\", which means that it has almost been reached, since non-tyre manufacturing activities already account for 16% of sales. \"The ambition is still to have a significant portion of our business in these other types of composites, but we won't do stupid things to reach that level,\" Managing Chairman Florent M\u00e9n\u00e9gaux said during a presentation broadcast. Michelin also expects cumulative free cash flow before acquisitions of 5.5 billion euros over the period 2024-2026, compared with 4.4 billion euros between 2021-2023, chief financial executive Yves Chapot said.

Tesla avait en effet choisi le Salon VivaTech pour d\u00e9voiler en France son fameux pick-up en acier inoxydable, dont la carrosserie tout en angles semble sorti d'un film de science-fiction des ann\u00e9es 1970. La marque, qui exposait \u00e9galement ses autres mod\u00e8les sur son stand, n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 seule \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des voitures dans les all\u00e9es du Salon : Peugeot, Audi ou encore BYD ont \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de l'attrait grandissant de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement pour les constructeurs automobiles, \u00e0 l'image de ce qui se passe au Consumer Electronic Show de Las Vegas. VivaTech est d'abord un \u00e9v\u00e9nement consacr\u00e9 aux start-up, et le secteur en a vu d\u00e9bouler un certain nombre ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Togg, la toute nouvelle marque turque de voitures \u00e9lectriques, en est, par exemple, \u00e0 sa troisi\u00e8me participation, et s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour cette \u00e9dition au rang de sponsor. Xpeng, jeune pousse chinoise qui se lance ce mois-ci dans l'Hexagone et cherche \u00e0 faire grimper sa notori\u00e9t\u00e9, s'est fait inviter sur le stand de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation chinoise.

Et BYD montrait la Seal U, la version hybride rechargeable du mod\u00e8le jusqu'\u00e0 vendu uniquement en 100 % \u00e9lectrique. D'autres groupes avaient choisi de prendre un stand sans y montrer de voiture. Toyota d\u00e9taillait ainsi son projet de ville du futur, et Renault, avec ses alli\u00e9s de la Software R\u00e9publique, d\u00e9voilait un concept de v\u00e9hicule utilitaire apportant des services de sant\u00e9 au plus pr\u00e8s des usagers.

In addition to the construction of a complete vehicle factory (EV Factory) for EVs and a battery factory for EVs, the two companies will consider establishing a production system for major battery components in Canada by establishing a joint venture with a partner company. The EV factory's maximum annual production capacity is assumed to be 240,000 units, and the company plans to start operation in 2028. The annual maximum production capacity of Battery Factory is assumed to be 36 GW scale. Both plants will be constructed adjacent to the existing plant of Honda of Canada Manufacturing (Ontario State), which produces four-wheeled vehicles.  In addition, regarding the main components of the battery, POSCO Future M of Korea will be the positive electrode material, and Asahi Kasei will be the separator, and the two companies will consider launching a joint production plant in Canada. The total investment amount related to the value chain construction is currently estimated to be approximately 15 billion Canadian dollars (approximately 1,715 billion yen), including investment from partner companies. It is also planning to receive subsidies from the Canadian government and Ontario State. Honda has set the goal of \"100% EV/FCEV sales ratio in 2040\", and in North America, which is the largest market in the world, Honda is promoting the establishment of the foundation for the EV production system with the factory in Ohio State as the hub. In Canada, the second phase of the initiative, it aims to build a comprehensive value chain from raw material procurement to finished vehicle production by utilizing the country's rich resources and clean energy. It will establish a stable supply system for batteries, which are the key components of EVs, and increase the cost competitiveness of the entire EV.

Le 'Capital Markets Day' de ce mercredi a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'occasion pour le groupe Michelin de mettre en valeur son pouvoir d'innovation et sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exploiter au sein de plusieurs m\u00e9tiers dans les domaines du pneumatique, des solutions connect\u00e9es et des solutions composites polym\u00e8res. De quoi revenir sur la strat\u00e9gie du groupe, sa vision \"durable\" \u00e0 l'horizon 2030, ses nouveaux objectifs \u00e0 moyen terme fix\u00e9s pour 2026, et une actualisation des ambitions 'Michelin 2030'. Michelin a annonc\u00e9 viser pour 2026 une hausse de sa marge op\u00e9rationnelle des secteurs \u00e0 14% gr\u00e2ce aux ventes de pneumatiques \u00e0 plus forte valeur ajout\u00e9e, notamment pour les SUV et les voitures \u00e9lectriques. Le groupe clermontois, dont la marge op\u00e9rationnelle est ressortie \u00e0 12,6% l'an dernier, a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion de sa journ\u00e9e investisseurs qu'une reprise des volumes, un fort effet mix-produit et la hausse de ses ventes hors pneumatiques devraient lui permettre d'atteindre un r\u00e9sultat op\u00e9rationnel des secteurs de 4,2 MdsE en 2026, contre 3,6 MdsE en 2023. Michelin table par ailleurs sur un flux de tr\u00e9sorerie disponible avant acquisitions cumul\u00e9 de 5,5 MdsE sur la p\u00e9riode 2024-2026, contre 4,4 MdsE entre 2021 et 2023. Sur la p\u00e9riode 2021-2023, la capacit\u00e9 d'innovation du groupe lui a permis de se d\u00e9velopper \u00e0 la fois dans ses m\u00e9tiers du pneumatique et les entreprises autres que les pneumatiques. En d\u00e9ployant son expertise dans le pneumatique, et donc dans la science des mat\u00e9riaux composites, Michelin a pu se d\u00e9velopper sur de nouveaux march\u00e9s cr\u00e9ateurs de valeur et porteurs de croissance, et est devenu moins d\u00e9pendant des fluctuations cycliques. Objectifs 2023 atteints, premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape r\u00e9ussie Lors de son Capital Markets Day (CMD) organis\u00e9 en avril 2021, le Groupe avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son plan strat\u00e9gique 'Michelin in Motion' avec ses ambitions pour 2030 et avait fourni des objectifs financiers pour 2023, ajust\u00e9s lors du CMD de mars 2023. La performance financi\u00e8re de la p\u00e9riode 2021-2023 montre une croissance, un r\u00e9sultat op\u00e9rationnel sectoriel et cr\u00e9ation de valeur sup\u00e9rieure aux objectifs et le maintien du taux de marge du Groupe malgr\u00e9 l'impact dilutif de l'inflation. Sur la p\u00e9riode, Michelin a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des acquisitions pour un montant de 1 milliard d'euros, principalement dans les domaines des Composites Polym\u00e8res et Solutions connect\u00e9es. Le groupe a pu d\u00e9montrer sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 int\u00e9grer les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s acquises et g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des synergies, ainsi que sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer activement son portefeuille. Le Groupe r\u00e9affirme sa strat\u00e9gie et actualise ses ambitions 2030 Le groupe a partag\u00e9 aujourd'hui son ambition de d\u00e9velopper ses activit\u00e9s hors pneumatiques \u00e0 hauteur de plus de 20% de son chiffre d'affaires total d'ici 2030, soutenu par des fusions et acquisitions cr\u00e9atrices de valeur. Le groupe pr\u00e9voyait jusqu'ici que les activit\u00e9s de diversification repr\u00e9sentent 20% \u00e0 30% de ses ventes nettes totales \u00e0 l'horizon 2030. Cet objectif a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 abaiss\u00e9 \u00e0 \"plus de 20%\", et vaut d\u00e9sormais aussi pour la distribution de pneus aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des solutions connect\u00e9es, des polym\u00e8res et du \"lifestyle\", ce qui signifie que l'objectif est d\u00e9sormais presque atteint puisque les activit\u00e9s \"hors fabrication de pneus\" p\u00e8sent d\u00e9j\u00e0 16% des ventes du groupe... Notons que Michelin a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 pour 4,5 MdsE d'acquisitions en 2018-19 et pour 1 MdE entre 2021 et 2023, la direction disposant d'un budget de 5 \u00e0 10 MdsE pour la suite. La politique de retour aux actionnaires de Michelin a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e avec un objectif de taux de distribution d'environ 50% du r\u00e9sultat net.

As included in the Information(Document LCDVP00020240528ek5s002p9) \nAccess the original document here\n \r\n                        Isuzu launches Japan's first BEV flat-floor route bus, ERGA EV - Moving towards carbon neutrality in public transportation Today, Isuzu Motors Limited (headquartered in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; President and COO: Shinsuke Minami; hereinafter \"Isuzu\") is launching the first of a series of battery electric vehicle (BEV) flat-floor route buses, \"ERGA EV\" (short wheelbase urban model), in Japan. The bus made its world premiere at the Japan Mobility Show 2023, held in October-November last year. In addition to incorporating zero-emission BEV technology, ERGA EV is the first bus in Japan with a fully flat-floor design. The ERGA EV will be at the forefront of introducing next-generation buses in Japan, driving the momentum towards carbon neutrality (CN) in public transportation. ERGA EV short wheelbase urban model The Japanese government`s \"Green Growth Strategy Through Achieving Carbon Neutrality in 2050\", calls on bus operators to work toward decarbonization. Isuzu believes that BEVs show great promise as a CN power source for route buses that travel primarily on predetermined routes. In addition, there are high expectations for technologically advanced BEV route buses since the 2025 Japan International Exposition (Osaka-Kansai Expo) is scheduled to open in April next year. Isuzu has been developing a BEV route bus that takes into account passengers, drivers, and road conditions, drawing on its many years of product development experience. \u3010Main features\u3011 ERGA EV has a lowered floor thanks to the use of \"in-axle motors\", where a motor is built into each side of the rear axle. By locating the battery packs on the roof and under the floor at the rear of the vehicle, the barrier-free layout maximizes flexibility, with no steps from the front entrance to the rearmost seat. Passenger convenience and safety are dramatically improved. The smooth acceleration of the BEV, coupled with low noise and vibration, has also greatly improved comfort. Fully flat-floor design maximizes passenger convenience and comfort High-voltage battery layout ERGA EV also has the same range as conventional route buses, while providing the same dynamic performance as diesel engine models.*1 It employs a high-voltage battery that can be charged using Japan's standard 350 V chargers and can be recharged from 20% to 80% in 3.2 hours.*2 In the event of a disaster, ERGA EV can be connected to an external power supply device that draws power from the vehicle, to power home appliances for example. (V2L function*3). \u3010Safety\u3011 ERGA EV has the same operability as conventional diesel models, with similar gauges and controls around the driver's seat as well as creep capability, while prioritizing safety and driver comfort. In terms of advanced safety features, ERGA EV is the first route bus in Japan to be equipped DSM*4 and EDSS*5, which detect driver abnormalities and bring the vehicle to a safe stop even on a slope. In addition, the bus is equipped with a blind spot monitor that detects and alerts the driver of pedestrians or vehicles beside the bus, helping avoid accidents. \u3010Connectivity\u3011 A first among buses, ERGA EV comes with Isuzu's advanced connected service, PREISM, which enables remote monitoring of the vehicle`s operational status. With PREISM, bus operating companies can monitor battery's state of charge (SOC*6) and driving range, giving new BEV bus operators the same peace of mind as in the past. The operation of BEV route buses requires the use of quick chargers, which can result in higher electricity costs due to increased demand during peak times. To this end, Isuzu's operation management service has expanded functions for charging schedules and remote charging management, and can also be linked to the bus operators energy management system. The service helps minimize electricity costs facing bus operators by implementing charging schedules based on power generation forecasts. In line with the company`s purpose, \"Moving the World - for You\", Isuzu remains committed to providing solutions to the challenges faced by customers, society, and all stakeholders, for a better tomorrow. * *1 Driving range may vary depending on such factors as outside temperature, use of air conditioning, and number of passengers. * *2 Quick charging (CHAdeMO) at 20 \u00b0C outside temperature and 50 kW charge output. * *3 Vehicle to Load. Compatible with the prevailing standard in Japan (EVPS-004: 2014). * *4 Driver Status Monitor * *5 Emergency Driving Stop System * *6 State of Charge.

SANS VOLANT ET SANS CONDUCTEUR, IL EFFECTUE SES PREMIERS TOURS DE ROUE \u00c0 PARIS, PENDANT LA QUINZAINE DE ROLAND-GARROS. Si vous circulez aux abords de Roland Garros dans les prochains jours, vous risquez de croiser la route d'un dr\u00f4le de minibus aux couleurs de Renault, le partenaire du tournoi de tennis. Ce n'est pas de la science-fiction. Ce v\u00e9hicule \u00e9lectrique aux larges baies vitr\u00e9es et dot\u00e9s d'\u00e9normes cam\u00e9ras \u00e0 chaque coin de son pavillon se d\u00e9place sans conducteur, le niveau 4 d'autonomie sur une \u00e9chelle de 5 pour les professionnels. Comme le m\u00e9tro qui fait la navette entre les diff\u00e9rents halls de l'a\u00e9roport de Roissy Charles de Gaulle. Ce robot minibus ne s'encombre ni d'un poste de conduite, ni d'un volant. Et l'on ne sait m\u00eame pas distinguer l'avant de l'arri\u00e8re. Quelques jours avant qu'il ne prenne la route de la porte d'Auteuil, \u00e0 Paris, nous avons eu l'occasion de prendre place \u00e0 son bord dans l'enceinte du Technocentre, le centre technique du groupe Renault, situ\u00e9 dans la zone d'activit\u00e9 de Guyancourt, pr\u00e8s de Versailles. Ce v\u00e9hicule nous transporte d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le futur, donnant un aper\u00e7u des transports publics de demain. Encore \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat exp\u00e9rimental, cette navette autonome fonctionne d\u00e9j\u00e0 parfaitement. Nous avons pu nous en rendre compte sur un parcours de 3\u00a0kilom\u00e8tres trac\u00e9 dans les art\u00e8res du centre de technique du Losange, o\u00f9 travaillent plus de 7\u00a0000\u00a0personnes. C\u00f4t\u00e9 droit, les portes s'\u00e9cartent \u00e9lectriquement, d\u00e9gageant un large acc\u00e8s pour p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans cet espace qui ressemble \u00e0 un wagon. On prend place sur l'une des quatre banquettes dispos\u00e9es en file indienne. La porte se referme. L'ing\u00e9nieur de Renault, qui nous accompagne, demande de boucler sa ceinture. On n'est jamais assez pr\u00e9voyant. La navette n'a pas de chauffeur mais un superviseur assis \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re surveille tout de m\u00eame la bonne marche des op\u00e9rations. Il a la main sur le bouton d'urgence rouge. Le moindre accroc et il presse le bouton, comme un candidat du jeu \u00ab\u00a0Questions pour un champion\u00a0\u00bb. Au plafond, un \u00e9cran divis\u00e9 en deux fen\u00eatres restitue l'image de la cam\u00e9ra vers l'avant ainsi que la mod\u00e9lisation du parcours. La navette quitte son emplacement en douceur et acc\u00e9l\u00e8re progressivement. Elle est capable de rouler jusqu'\u00e0 70\u00a0km/h, en fonction des besoins et de l'environnement. Dans notre cas, nous ne d\u00e9passerons pas 40\u00a0km/h. Largement suffisant dans un milieu habit\u00e9. La Pr\u00e9vention routi\u00e8re vient d'ailleurs de s'emparer du sujet en lan\u00e7ant une p\u00e9tition pour la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation de l'abaissement \u00e0 30\u00a0km/h de la vitesse maximale en ville. Dans l'avenue emprunt\u00e9e, 200\u00a0m\u00e8tres devant nous, un camion est arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur la voie d'en face. Un v\u00e9hicule le double. Vraiment pr\u00e9venante, notre navette ralentit l'allure. Premier virage \u00e0 angle droit. Elle le n\u00e9gocie sans heurt et sans louvoyer. Bluffant. Plus loin, des pi\u00e9tons sont post\u00e9s au bord d'un passage prot\u00e9g\u00e9. La navette les a vus. Elle s'arr\u00eate. Les pi\u00e9tons temporisent. Veulent-ils vraiment traverser\u00a0? Moment d'h\u00e9sitation. Notre minibus est vraiment prudent et poli. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 programm\u00e9 comme cela. Pas question qu'il arrive quoi que ce soit. Il attend que le groupe rejoigne l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue et red\u00e9marre. Encore deux rues \u00e0 emprunter et nous voici revenus \u00e0 notre point de d\u00e9part. La navette retrouve son emplacement en se garant automatiquement en marche arri\u00e8re. Un chauffeur n'aurait pas fait mieux. Cette performance s'appuie sur la technologie d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par l'entreprise chinoise WeRide. \u00ab\u00a0Nous avons investi avec Nissan dans cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui poss\u00e8de l'une des meilleures technologies du march\u00e9\u00a0\u00bb , assure Gilles Le\u00a0Borgne, le directeur de l'ing\u00e9nierie du groupe Renault. WeRide peut d\u00e9j\u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir d'avoir couvert plus de 28\u00a0millions de kilom\u00e8tres et 1\u00a0600\u00a0jours de conduite en cumulant ses 700\u00a0v\u00e9hicules autonomes en service, dont 300\u00a0minibus. Les deux navettes qui vont circuler pendant quinze jours du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Roland-Garros embarquent des syst\u00e8mes ultra-sophistiqu\u00e9s\u00a0: 10\u00a0cam\u00e9ras et 6\u00a0lidars dont deux \u00e0 l'avant et quatre r\u00e9partis sur le toit. Ces \u00e9quipements voient mieux qu'un humain, surveillant en permanence les abords du v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 360 degr\u00e9s, que ce soit des v\u00e9hicules immobiles ou en mouvement, des pi\u00e9tons et tous types de v\u00e9hicules, y compris des trottinettes ou des engins personnels de mobilit\u00e9. Le syst\u00e8me interpr\u00e8te la trajectoire de tous les usagers. Il a aussi envisag\u00e9 tous les sc\u00e9narios de conduite. Les cam\u00e9ras sont capables de voir \u00e0 une distance de 100\u00a0m\u00a0; les lidars, qui enregistrent les \u00e9chos, de 150 \u00e0 300\u00a0m. Et la navette autonome ne pourrait pas s'aventurer sur la route sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement cartographi\u00e9 son parcours. Rien n'est laiss\u00e9 au hasard. Et maintenant\u00a0? Renault estime que les conditions sont r\u00e9unies pour passer \u00e0 une phase plus active. Le constructeur fran\u00e7ais veut profiter de la mise en place d'un cadre l\u00e9gislatif autorisant la circulation de ces v\u00e9hicules de niveau\u00a04 pour montrer qu'il ma\u00eetrise l'ensemble de la cha\u00eene de la navette autonome, le v\u00e9hicule avec la plateforme \u00e9lectrique du nouveau Master, la transformation en navette autonome avec ses filiales et la technologie autonome avec WeRide. \u00ab\u00a0Dans les ann\u00e9es qui viennent, plus de 400\u00a0000\u00a0villes vont mettre en place des restrictions de circulation, soit avec des zones \u00e0 faibles \u00e9missions, soit en d\u00e9cidant de devenir neutre en termes de carbone, mais les usages vont aussi \u00e9voluer\u00a0\u00bb , explique l'ing\u00e9nieur Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Salessy. De nombreux atouts militent en faveur du d\u00e9veloppement des navettes autonomes en ville. Pour les usagers, c'est l'assurance d'une disponibilit\u00e9 et d'une fr\u00e9quence de service acceptable, d'une fiabilit\u00e9 des horaires et d'un co\u00fbt d'abonnement r\u00e9duit. Pour les municipalit\u00e9s, ces v\u00e9hicules permettent de d\u00e9ployer des solutions \u00e9cologiques \u00e0 un co\u00fbt inf\u00e9rieur aux autres solutions de transport public. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Salessy souligne \u00ab\u00a0que des infrastructures de tramway co\u00fbtent de 20 \u00e0 70\u00a0euros du kilom\u00e8tre, 500\u00a0millions d'euros du kilom\u00e8tre pour le m\u00e9tro et de l'ordre de 600\u00a0000\u00a0euros pour un bus. Ces infrastructures sont aussi peu flexibles puisque les routes sont d\u00e9finies et vous ne pouvez pas les changer. En comparaison, le co\u00fbt d'une navette est de l'ordre de 350\u00a0000\u00a0\u00e0 450\u00a0000 euros. Sans compter qu'il est tr\u00e8s facile de d\u00e9ployer de nouvelles routes.\u00a0\u00bb Pour les municipalit\u00e9s et les acteurs du transport public, les avantages ne sont pas n\u00e9gligeables. La navette autonome optimise les questions du dimensionnement des v\u00e9hicules et r\u00e9sout le sujet du recrutement, de la formation et de la disponibilit\u00e9 des chauffeurs. C'est la pr\u00e9occupation principale de Jean Castex. R\u00e9cemment, le pr\u00e9sident de la RATP a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 le niveau d'absent\u00e9isme trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 des conducteurs de bus ou de m\u00e9tro. \u00ab\u00a0Le co\u00fbt des chauffeurs repr\u00e9sente environ les deux tiers des co\u00fbts d'exploitation des services de mobilit\u00e9\u00a0\u00bb , admet l'ing\u00e9nieur de Renault. Lorsque l'on pose l'ensemble des param\u00e8tres sur la table, il ne fait pas de doute que l'avenir de la navette autonome s'annonce radieux.",

      "complete_entry": "Short Torque\n China Daily, Monday, 27  May 2024, 793 Words, Copyright 2024, China Daily Multimedia Co. Ltd. All Rights Reserved.(Document CHNDLY0020240527ek5r0000b) AI operating system rolls out by Xpeng\r\n                      Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng rolled out its artificial intelligence-powered in-car operating system last week, with the aim of delivering full autonomous driving in China by 2025. The system, XOS 5.1.0, Tianji, integrates end-to-end large model technology and is the first of its kind to be mass-produced in China, according to Xpeng. The system will be gradually applied to all Xpeng vehicles and continually improve via over-the-air updates. Xpeng also announced that by the third quarter of 2024, its intelligent driving system will be able to cover every road nationwide. CEO He Xiaopeng said that its end-to-end large model aims for iterations every two days with a goal to increase autonomous driving capabilities by 30 times within 18 months. He also mentioned that the first model of its Mona sub-brand will be unveiled in June. \r\n                     Apollo Go robotaxis forecast for profit \r\n                     Baidu said its Apollo Go robotaxi arm is expected to turn a profit in 2025. Baidu is one of the major players in China's nascent robotaxi market and received permission from a Beijing city district to begin charging fares in November 2021. Apollo Go operated about 839,000 rides across the country in the last three months of 2023, according to Baidu's latest earnings report. In Wuhan, Hubei province, about 45 percent of orders in the fourth quarter were fully driverless, up from 40 percent in the previous quarter, the company said. In addition to growing usage and lower labor costs per ride, Baidu is making cars cheaper. It announced in mid-May that Apollo's sixth-generation robotaxi will cost around 200,000 yuan ($28,169). \r\n                     Tesla begins Megapacks factory in Shanghai The United States electric vehicle giant Tesla broke ground on a megafactory in Shanghai on Thursday to manufacture its energy-storage batteries, Megapacks. The project was hailed by the company as a milestone. The latest move underscores Tesla's commitment to investing in the world's second-largest economy, defying the rhetoric of \"decoupling\" and \"derisking\" from China which is being ratcheted up by some US politicians. The new plant spans an area of 200,000 square meters, with a total investment of around 1.45 billion yuan ($203.94 million). The megafactory is the first of its kind built by Tesla outside the US. It is also the company's second plant in Shanghai, following the inauguration of its gigafactory in 2019. No electric car can sing like a V10, says Lambo Lamborghini is holding off for now on making its sports cars fully electric as skepticism around the technology grows. While performance will not be an issue in an electric vehicle, some emotional aspects - such as the sound of a Huracan's V10 engine - cannot be replicated, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said. The Volkswagen Group-owned brand also remains open to use e-fuels if regulation becomes more favorable. Fully electric supercars are \"not something that is selling so far\", Winkelmann said in an interview. \"It's too early and we have to see down the road if and when this is going to happen,\" he added. Budget SUV launched on new platform by Kia\r\n                   \r\n                     Kia launched the company's first compact electric sport utility vehicle built on its dedicated electric vehicle platform on Thursday. The company is betting it can win over buyers through competitive pricing even as momentum in the global EV market stalls. The EV3 is one of more than 31 electric models that Hyundai Motor Group - which includes Hyundai Motor, Kia and premium brand Genesis - plans to introduce in the period through to 2030. Kia said in April that it aims to sell about 1.6 million EV units in 2030.Kia President Song Ho-Sung said the South Korean automaker aimed to price the EV3, based on its dedicated Electrified-Global Modular Platform, in the $35,000 to $50,000 range. Thailand's automotive production keeps falling Thailand's auto production continued to drop in April due to long holidays and weaker demand in the domestic market, data from the Federation of Thai Industries showed on Thursday. Thai auto manufacturers produced 104,667 vehicles in April, down 11.02 percent from a year earlier and slowing from a 23.08 percent plunge in March, owing to a major fall in the output of pickup trucks and internal combustion engine passenger cars, according to the FTI. However, battery electric vehicle manufacturing jumped 2,476 percent year-on-year to 644 units in April as local production picked up pace, while that of hybrid EVs expanded 106.43 percent to 13,732 units, the FTI said in a statement.

Dessin\u00e9e et con\u00e7ue en Italie, elle sera assembl\u00e9e en Espagne avec des moteurs fran\u00e7ais. De quoi encore faire enrager le gouvernement italien ? La citadine se veut la Mini de Stellantis \u00e0 partir de 24 500 euros. Encore une nouvelle voiture italienne de Stellantis d\u00e9localis\u00e9e ? Alors qu\u2019il est en conflit ouvert avec le gouvernement de Giorgia Meloni, Carlos Tavares a pris les devants lundi, lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de la Lancia Ypsilon en plein c\u0153ur de Turin. Le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Stellantis en effet martel\u00e9 que cette citadine chic et snob avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab cr\u00e9\u00e9e et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e \u00e0 Turin \u00bb, que c\u2019\u00e9tait donc un \u00ab pur produit italien \u00bb ! Certes, elle sera fabriqu\u00e9e \u00e0 Saragosse aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la Peugeot 208. Mais l\u2019assemblage, c\u2019est \u00ab 10 % \u00e0 peine de la valeur ajout\u00e9e d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00bb, a ajout\u00e9 avec d\u00e9dain le dirigeant, \u00e0 l\u2019intention \u00ab de ceux qui ne connaissent pas l\u2019industrie \u00bb. Et toc pour les pouvoirs publics transalpins, qui lui reprochent depuis des mois de ne pas assembler ses nouveaux v\u00e9hicules en Italie ! Lire aussiLe gouvernement italien force Stellantis \u00e0 d\u00e9baptiser l\u2019Alfa Milano\n Carlos Tavares \u00e9tait visiblement agac\u00e9 par son bras de fer avec les autorit\u00e9s politiques. En minimisant la part de l\u2019assemblage dans le co\u00fbt d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule, il a toutefois commis une grave erreur. Car on peut d\u00e8s lors lui retourner l\u2019argument : pourquoi d\u00e9localiser si les co\u00fbts d\u2019assemblage sont si faibles ? En outre, dans sa fougue, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Stellantis a omis de dire que les moteurs de la Lancia Ypsilon \u00e9taient produits en France, o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement cr\u00e9\u00e9e la plateforme, celle de la Peugeot 208\u2026 En marge de cette pr\u00e9sentation, Carlos Tavares avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lundi aux syndicats italiens \u00ab des perspectives concr\u00e8tes concernant l\u2019attribution de mod\u00e8les dans les usines italiennes de Stellantis jusqu\u2019en 2030 et au-del\u00e0 \u00bb. Il a notamment annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de 2026 une version hybride de la Fiat 500 commercialis\u00e9e jusqu\u2019ici uniquement en \u00e9lectrique. Histoire d\u2019accro\u00eetre la production de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 des Alpes. Il a confirm\u00e9 \u00ab l\u2019ambition partag\u00e9e avec le gouvernement italien d\u2019atteindre un million de v\u00e9hicules produits en Italie d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030 \u00bb (752 000 v\u00e9hicules en 2023). Mais sous condition d\u2019 \u00ab un environnement commercial favorable, actuellement affect\u00e9 par les incertitudes li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectrification et la forte concurrence avec les nouveaux arrivants sur le march\u00e9 \u00bb. A bon entendeur\u2026 Pass\u00e9 prestigieux, pr\u00e9sent sacrifi\u00e9 \r\n                     Stellantis a pris en tout cas un gros risque en tentant la renaissance d\u2019une marque au pass\u00e9 certes prestigieux, mais moribonde aujourd\u2019hui. \u00ab Il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019investissement pr\u00e9vu (avant la formation de Stellantis) et la marque allait dispara\u00eetre \u00bb, a d\u2019ailleurs soulign\u00e9 perfidement Carlos Tavares, \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la presse italienne et de quelques journalistes \u00e9trangers \u2013 Challenges \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent. John Elkann, pr\u00e9sident de Stellantis et h\u00e9ritier des Agnelli, participait aussi \u00e0 cette c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de lancement qui, pour une fois, ne se d\u00e9roulait pas en anglais, mais en italien, histoire de rench\u00e9rir sur l\u2019italianit\u00e9. Relancer un label haut de gamme, alors que, au sein de Stellantis, DS et Alfa Romeo sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la peine, est une gageure comme les aime le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, passionn\u00e9 de voitures et de course automobile. Lancia ne fut-il pas champion du monde des rallyes en d\u00e9tenant le record du plus grand nombre de victoires et de titres remport\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la Fulvia HF coup\u00e9, puis la Stratos et la Delta Integrale ? Lire aussiTavares et Stellantis offrent \u00e0 Lancia les moyens de sa r\u00e9surrection\n La toute nouvelle Ypsilon \u2013 Lancia a toujours pris\u00e9 les lettres de l\u2019alphabet grec \u2013, est une petite auto raffin\u00e9e de 4,08 m\u00e8tres de long seulement, revendiquant des lignes originales, un int\u00e9rieur avec des couleurs chaudes et\u2026 \u00ab 60 % environ de pi\u00e8ces communes en valeur avec une Peugeot 208 \u00bb, indique Fran\u00e7ois Daviaud, responsable du projet. Des \u00e9conomies d\u2019\u00e9chelle indispensables pour abaisser le ticket d\u2019entr\u00e9e et minimiser les risques. Personne n\u2019a voulu nous pr\u00e9ciser les objectifs. Mais on peut parier sur un objectif minimal de 40 000 unit\u00e9s. Les moteurs (hybride de 100 chevaux et \u00e9lectrique de 156) sont conjoints. Mais aussi le pare-brise, certains vitrages lat\u00e9raux, les structures de si\u00e8ges. L\u2019aileron en haut de la lunette arri\u00e8re est chip\u00e9, lui, \u00e0 la cousine Opel Corsa. Prix de base de cette Ypsilon 2024 : 24 500 euros en hybride, 34 800 en \u00e9lectrique. Une facture assez sal\u00e9e, qui culmine \u00e0 39 500 euros pour la version la plus hupp\u00e9e. Un d\u00e9fi suppl\u00e9mentaire. Car c\u2019est au moins 10 000 euros de plus que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente Ypsilon datant de 2011, laquelle \u00e9tait vendue jusqu\u2019ici en Italie \u00e0 un tarif ultra-comp\u00e9titif : \u00e0 partir de 15 000 euros. Il s\u2019en est d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9coul\u00e9 45 000 unit\u00e9s l\u2019an dernier. Un sacr\u00e9 saut tarifaire. La marque renaissante esp\u00e8re toutefois retrouver une partie des clients de l\u2019ancien mod\u00e8le. Tout en en captant de nouveaux. \u00ab Lancia vise d\u00e9sormais des clients de l\u2019Audi A1, la Mini \u00bb, souligne Luca Napolitano, directeur de la marque. \u00ab On cible les clients urbains dont ce sera principalement la deuxi\u00e8me voiture \u00bb, ajoute-t-il. Avec, esp\u00e8re-t-il, un certain rajeunissement des acheteurs, \u00ab autour de 45-50 ans \u00bb. 80\u2009% en Italie L\u2019Italie sera le march\u00e9 principal, qui absorbera \u00ab 80 % de notre production \u00bb, pr\u00e9cise Luca Napolitano. La voiture sera toutefois \u00e9galement lanc\u00e9e en Espagne, aux Pays-Bas, en Belgique, mais aussi en France puis en Allemagne. Mais l\u2019Ypsilon ne sortira pas du Vieux continent. La marque, qui emploie en direct \u00e0 peine 22 personnes, commencera ses livraisons dans l\u2019Hexagone en novembre \u00e0 travers un r\u00e9seau s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 et r\u00e9duit de 20 concessionnaires. Le film publicitaire c\u00e9l\u00e8bre les vertus du style, du design et de la mode italiens, \u00e0 travers une \u00e9vocation de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gance f\u00e9minine transalpine intemporelle. A l\u2019oppos\u00e9 du politiquement correct d\u00e9genr\u00e9 actuel\u2026 En jouant sur les am\u00e9nagements int\u00e9rieurs, la qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sentation, l\u2019Ypsilon a-t-elle des chances ? \u00ab Nous savons que ce sera un pari difficile \u00bb, insiste Gianni Petulla, directeur du produit Lancia. Mais \u00ab nous n\u2019avons pas pr\u00e9vu de perdre de l\u2019argent, m\u00eame pas sur une ann\u00e9e \u00bb, rench\u00e9rit Luca Napolitano. Le hic, c\u2019est que ce label n\u00e9 en 1906 est bien oubli\u00e9 en Europe aujourd\u2019hui, sauf dans son pays d\u2019origine. Et ceux qui s\u2019en souviennent encore \u00e9voquent certes quelques mod\u00e8les embl\u00e9matiques, mais aussi une fiabilit\u00e9 al\u00e9atoire et un r\u00e9seau m\u00e9diocre. En fait, le groupe Fiat n\u2019a jamais su quoi faire de ce label r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 il y a 55 ans, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a connu de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. Le premier jalon du renouveau \nLancia a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 sacrifi\u00e9 au profit d\u2019Alfa, \u00e9galement rachet\u00e9 par Fiat (en 1986). Mais in fine les deux marques auront \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9es de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re erratique. Comble de la d\u00e9cadence : lorsqu\u2019il reprendra Chrysler en 2010, Fiat affublera la gamme Lancia de mod\u00e8les am\u00e9ricains obsol\u00e8tes, qui finiront par dynamiter ce qu\u2019il restait de l\u2019image de noblesse et de grande classe chez Lancia. Une gestion catastrophique, on l\u2019a dit. L\u2019Ypsilon se veut le premier jalon du renouveau. Une version sportive HF \u00e9lectrique de 240 chevaux arrivera dans un an. Puis, dans deux ans, sera commercialis\u00e9e une grande berline \u00e9lectrique de 4,70 m\u00e8tres de long. Elle s\u2019appellera Gamma, du nom d\u2019un mod\u00e8le des ann\u00e9es 1970 qui fut\u2026 un \u00e9chec commercial patent ! Enfin, en 2028, Lancia devrait relancer la Delta, une berline compacte qui rappellera la berline \u00e9ponyme de 1979, un des mod\u00e8les les plus mythiques de son prestigieux pass\u00e9. \u00ab On a une vision jusqu\u2019en 2030 \u00bb, souligne Gianni Petulla. Mais il faudra faire ses preuves.",

All Rights Reserved. Distributed by NewsBank, Inc.(Document POSTCW0020240526ek5q0006b) Like most mainstream automakers, storied sports car manufacturers like Ferrari and Maserati have to conform to a new a landscape that praises efficiency and is also prepared for electrification. But while the Prancing Horse and the Trident can make do with selling sleek, low-slung, expensive sports cars with small, but powerful turbocharged V6 engines, it just doesn't cut it for British marque Aston Martin. (AMGDF) The brand preferred by James Bond likes to do things different. In a recent interview, one of its key executives defended why it is choosing to stick with big, brash V8 and V12 engines for the near future.

Future Publishing/Getty Images In an interview with British automotive blog Car Throttle, Aston Martin Product and Marketing Strategy head Alex Long said that supercar buyers are not into buying these type of cars strictly for its performance capabilities or top speed figures, rather seeking an \"emotional connection\" with their cars through things they can feel, hear and touch. \"[Cars powered by] V8s have a true emotional connection as do V12s [\u2026] in a way that perhaps V6 [cars] doesn't yet,\" Long told Car Throttle. \"It's not just about going as fast as I can. I do want some emotion on the way, I want some real sound and rumble.\" Additionally, Long alludes to the idea that a \"small\" engine like a V6 essentially \"cheapens\" the prospect of a \"premium\" car like an Aston Martin. \"I want to know and think and say it's a V8 or a V12 because V8s [and] V12s have generally been reserved for very special and interesting products whereas V6s very much aren't in the premium segment.\" Long noted that customer demand for V8s have dramatically increased after the Covid-19 pandemic, which he attributes to the driving patterns of Aston Martin buyers. He notes that these buyers often have more than one car in their garage, reserving the Aston for weekends or special occasions that \"don't cut the mileages;\" times where hearing a big, grumbling V8 engine would feel refreshing. \"There are very many Aston customers who will also own an electric car in the household, but they'll want still sound, noise, vibration and so on from a supercar that's a V8,\" Long noted. However, keeping those big V8 and V12 motors in these cars are technological wonders themselves, as these motors have evolved to incorporate technologies like turbocharging in order to comply with increasingly strict emissions regulations. But, as engine technology evolves and its parts get even more complex, the big motors inside Aston Martins produce more power than ever before. \"At a time when we're going electric in the industry, we are at a phenomenal point in the sophistication of the combustion engine... nearly 200 horsepower per liter [from] these fantastic engines.\" More Automotive: \r\n                     Maserati exec defends the use of a car feature drivers hateFeds are skeptical about the safety of popular driver-assist techYoung guys who like loud cars are likely to be psychopaths, study suggests Related: Aston Martin head says its customers want 'sound and smells' from its sports cars Lawrence Stroll of Canada and Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team arrives at the track during the Sprint Shootout/Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of United States at Circuit of The Americas on Oct. 21, 2023 in Austin, United States.Song Haiyuan/MB Media/Getty Images Long's comments follow similar remarks from an April 2024 Autocar interview with Aston Martin Chairman Lawrence Stroll, where he declared that the brand will be selling combustion-powered cars well into the 2030s.

L'industriel r\u00e9alise 84 % de son activit\u00e9 dans le pneu, et 16 % en dehors. La diversification, mais pas \u00e0 n'importe quel prix, ni \u00e0 un rythme trop rapide pour les march\u00e9s. Et surtout pas au risque de \u00ab faire des b\u00eatises \u00bb, a martel\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident de Michelin, Florent Menegaux, devant les investisseurs r\u00e9unis \u00e0 Clermont-Ferrand pour la journ\u00e9e investisseur du groupe. De fait, Michelin a annonc\u00e9 entre les lignes qu'il stoppait sa strat\u00e9gie de croissance externe pour se d\u00e9velopper \u00ab hors du pneu \u00bb. En 2021, lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de ses ambitions pour 2030, il avait \u00e9tonn\u00e9 les analystes en voulant faire cro\u00eetre ces activit\u00e9s de 5 % de son chiffre d'affaires \u00e0 plus de 20 % d'ici la fin de la d\u00e9cennie. Mercredi, Michelin n'a, facialement, pas modifi\u00e9 ses ambitions. Il dit viser toujours un euro sur cinq hors du pneu \u00e0 horizon 2030. Mais il a consid\u00e9rablement gonfl\u00e9 la base de comparaison, en ajoutant aux activit\u00e9s polym\u00e8re les services connect\u00e9s et la distribution. Ce nouveau p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre p\u00e8se aujourd'hui trois fois plus que l'ancien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en 2021, soit 16 % du chiffre d'affaires. Rassurer les march\u00e9s D'une multiplication par quatre de ses activit\u00e9s polym\u00e8re, le groupe est d\u00e9sormais pass\u00e9 \u00e0 une ambition d'augmenter marginalement de 4 points ses activit\u00e9s hors pneus en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Michelin n'abandonne pas sa strat\u00e9gie de diversification \u00e0 long terme mais revoit nettement \u00e0 la baisse ses objectifs. Il s'agit pour la direction du groupe de rassurer les march\u00e9s. Ceux-ci s'inqui\u00e9taient que pour atteindre le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent objectif \u00e0 tout prix, Michelin ne gaspille ses milliards. L'action a d'ailleurs gagn\u00e9 1,5 % dans la foul\u00e9e des annonces. Par ailleurs, le groupe pr\u00e9voit de redistribuer 4 milliards d'euros aux actionnaires ces trois prochaines ann\u00e9es, dont 1 milliard en rachat d'actions. Les march\u00e9s avaient mal accueilli l'objectif de 20 \u00e0 30 % annonc\u00e9 il y a trois ans. \u00ab La fa\u00e7on d'exprimer notre ambition change, parce que nous ne voulons pas que les march\u00e9s pensent que nous ferons des choses stupides pour r\u00e9aliser une acquisition afin de parvenir aux objectifs, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 Florent Menegaux devant les analystes. Nous sommes s\u00e9rieux sur cette ambition. \u00bb Michelin s'\u00e9tait mis dans une seringue. L'inqui\u00e9tude des investisseurs, a reconnu la direction, ne cessait de grossir au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le d\u00e9lai jusqu'\u00e0 l'objectif se r\u00e9tr\u00e9cissait. \u00ab A ce jour, nous r\u00e9alisons 84 % de notre activit\u00e9 dans le pneu, et 16 % en dehors, a insist\u00e9 Florent Menegaux. L'\u00e9cart entre 16 et 20 % peut \u00eatre raisonnablement combl\u00e9 d'ici 2030. \u00bb Comprendre : l'objectif peut \u00eatre rempli gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la croissance des activit\u00e9s existantes, sans sortir le ch\u00e9quier. M\u00eame si le groupe \u00ab ne s'engage \u00e0 rien en mati\u00e8re d'acquisition \u00bb, a insist\u00e9 Florent Menegaux, toute op\u00e9ration de croissance externe n'est pas exclue pour autant en fonction des opportunit\u00e9s. \u00ab L'activit\u00e9 de fusion acquisition est un sport d'\u00e9quipe maintenant chez Michelin, a fait valoir Yves Chapot, le directeur financier. Nous allons continuer \u00e0 g\u00e9rer activement notre portfolio, en suivant deux crit\u00e8res, strat\u00e9giques et financiers. \u00bb Pour ces trois prochaines ann\u00e9es, Michelin a fix\u00e9 de nouveaux objectifs financiers. Il table sur une croissance de son revenu op\u00e9rationnel de 3,6 \u00e0 4,2 milliards d'euros (+16 %). De quoi g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une marge op\u00e9rationnelle de 14 %, en hausse de deux points sur trois ans. Fermetures d'usine Comme ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, Michelin compte d'abord sur ses pneus de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, ceux pour l'agriculture, les avions ou les monstrueux pneumatiques de 5 m\u00e8tres de diam\u00e8tre des camions miniers, pour tirer sa profitabilit\u00e9. Il en attend \u00e0 horizon 2026 un taux de marge op\u00e9rationnelle de 18 %, contre plus de 14 % pour l'automobile et 10 % pour l'activit\u00e9 poids lourds. Pour atteindre ses objectifs \u00e0 2026, Michelin n'exclut pas de fermer de nouvelles usines afin d'am\u00e9liorer le taux d'utilisation des sites restants. \u00ab Le principal d\u00e9fi c\u00f4t\u00e9 profitabilit\u00e9 fut ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es la sous-utilisation de nos usines dans le monde, en particulier les sites d\u00e9di\u00e9s aux poids lourds en Europe, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 Yves Chapot. Nous voulons l'am\u00e9liorer de 9 points et le faire passer de 73 \u00e0 82 %. \u00bb \u00ab Nous revoyons constamment notre implantation, et nous avons encore des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre \u00bb, a reconnu Florent Menegaux. Les restructurations sont une constante chez Michelin ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ; \u00ab une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00bb, dit-il pour s'adapter \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution des march\u00e9s et des co\u00fbts observ\u00e9s sur chaque continent. La hausse du prix de l'\u00e9nergie a notamment p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 l'Europe. Le groupe a annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'automne dernier la fermeture de deux usines allemandes de fabrication de pneus pour poids lourds - activit\u00e9 la moins rentable du groupe - ainsi que d'une usine am\u00e9ricaine.",

The path to becoming a strong automaking nation lies in developing new-energy vehicles, Xi said, according to a 2014 Xinhua report. Claiming a head start, or \"high ground,\" in this sector is key to the competition globally, Xi said. In 2014, China sold around 75,000 EVs and hybrids and exported about 533,000 cars. The domestic market was dominated by international manufacturers such as Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which were allowed to enter by forming joint ventures with local players in the 1980s and 1990s. This helped China transform from a bike-riding nation to a car-driving one. Homegrown carmakers and brands that didn't work with foreign partners were seen as inferior and lagging behind in engine and other automotive technology. To get ahead and tackle environmental challenges, Beijing bet on fuel-efficient and alternative energy vehicles. The state had published a guideline in 2012 that established ways to develop the industry by setting sales goals, providing subsidies and allocating resources for building charging infrastructure, among other things. Xi's speech two years later signalled China's determination to use this as a way to leapfrog traditional Western and Asian auto powerhouses, in particular Japan, home to Toyota Motor Corp.\r\n                   With the stage set, China needed a catalyst to spur consumer interest in EVs, which in the early 2010s were mostly cheap cars with short ranges. That ended up being Tesla Inc., which became the first foreign automaker to set up a wholly-owned operation in China. With that special permission, Tesla completed its Shanghai factory in 2019. Its entry into the market motivated local players to come up with better EVs with longer ranges. Fast forward to 2024, and China has become the world's largest auto market and sells more electrified vehicles than any other country, with 9.5 million cars delivered last year. It also controls the majority of the battery supply chain. Homegrown champion BYD Co. dethroned Volkswagen to become the best-selling brand in China and in the last quarter of 2023, surpassed Tesla as the world's largest producer of EVs. China also overtook Japan as the largest auto exporter, sending 4.14 million units abroad with 1.55 million of them being EVs or plug-in hybrids. The achievements proved that Beijing's industrial policy and investments paid off. But they're also adding to tensions with the West. China's success in EVs, which could disrupt traditional auto supply chains that employ millions of people, has become a key source of discomfort in Washington and Brussels. As a price war at home and slowing growth drives Chinese automakers to search for buyers for their affordable and tech-laden EVs elsewhere, they're running into trade barriers, especially in the EU and the US, which are meanwhile trying to develop their own EV supply chains. Both have accused China of exporting its excess capacity. The US has quadrupled import tariffs on Chinese cars to more than 100%, while the EU is investigating Chinese EVs to see if there has been an unfair advantage from government subsidies. Brazil recently removed a tax break on imported EVs and even Russia, arguably Beijing's strongest ally and the largest destination for Chinese auto exports since the war with Ukraine, has asked Chinese carmakers to consider localizing production. Beijing has threatened to hit back, with the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU on May 22 saying that the import tariffs on cars with large engines may be raised to 25% from 15%. There's a June 5 deadline for the EU to inform Chinese EV exporters of preliminary findings and whether tariffs will be imposed. SAIC, the state-owned manufacturer whose facility Xi visited 10 years ago, happens to be one of the three Chinese automakers, along with BYD and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., selected for further scrutiny by the EU in its anti-subsidy investigation. SAIC owns the British-origin MG brand, which is one of the top-selling EVs in Europe. At an event marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's speech on Friday, SAIC officials including Chief Engineer Zu Sijie said they've remembered the president's instructions well, and the company has consistently innovated around technologies like smart driving and connected cars. Li Zheng, the co-founder of SAIC Qingtao New Energy Technology Co., a battery startup backed by SAIC, took the opportunity to promise executives won't be complacent as EV competition rises, noting that progress in solid-state batteries, which have a higher energy density and reduced fire risk, will be one way for China to maintain its edge. \"New-energy vehicles have become a strategic industry, fiercely contested by countries around the world,\" Li said. \"They're a key supporting force to our country's revitalization of green sectors.\" A lot can happen in 10 years, but with SAIC having invested about 150 billion yuan ($21 billion) into R&D over the past decade alone, even despite trade wars, 2034 looks bright.

The integration of LG's ACP into the recently unveiled Kia EV3 marks the first time the innovative solution has been applied to an electric vehicle.

Thanks to LG and Kia's close collaboration, the EV3 conveniently puts LG's powerful platform at each passenger's fingertips, enabling them to enjoy high-quality content on the car's built-in screens. From streaming services and social media platforms to educational content for kids, users have access to a variety of content previously only available on mobile devices or TV.* The webOS-based entertainment system from LG is continuously updated and enhanced, ensuring seamless integration with applications such as Baby Shark World for Kids. The mobile education app, beloved by children all over the world, presents over 9,000 songs and stories designed to educate and enthrall young learners and is readily available for download from the LG Content Store on the ACP.

While he's influenced a number of products in that time he will mostly be remembered for Dodge's Hellcat line that started with the original Challenger SRT Hellcat and Charger SRT Hellcat. They were launched for the 2015 model year with 707 hp from a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. Performance only went up from there. Additional highlights included 2018's Challenger SRT Demon and the 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170, the latter of which served as the sendoff for the line.

The presentation in the country would not take too long. The new images show the entire exterior design of the SUV, located in the B segment and developed with the same CMP modular platform of the 208, with which it is manufactured at the Buenos Aires plant. New designThe changes compared to the first generation arriving from Brazil are remarkable. Because the new model of the French brand has an aesthetic evolution associated with the current 208; they belong to the same generation of vehicles. Because of its delay in arriving in South America, this 2008 also has the redesign that Peugeot added to the European model last year, including changes to the front design (optics, grille and bumper), the wheels and the rear area (contains new features in the optics). The images of Autos Segredos show a \"full\" version that would be called GT. Among its details, it has a bodywork painted in two colors, including the black tone for the roof, front bumpers and mirrors. In the front configuration are present the optics with LED lighting and daytime running lights -also with LED- characteristic of the new 2008. In addition, it should be recalled that they had already discovered the interior. Interior revealedAlso belonging to the range-topping GT version, the cabin features Peugeot's i-Cockpit cockpit, which includes a compact steering wheel (in this case, with the version's acronym) and a raised, digital dashboard. Other notable features are the alcantara upholstery with exposed stitching, the appliqu\u00e9s that simulate carbon fiber and the command - in the center console - for the electronic parking brake, another novelty compared to the 208, which has a manual system). What the mechanics would be likeAnticipations from Brazil also indicate that the brand new 2008 will use Fiat's three-cylinder 1.0 turbo engine (T200), already present in the Argentine 208. It delivers 120 hp and 200 Nm of torque. The engine will be accompanied by the CVT automatic gearbox, with a continuously variable system and seven simulated gears, while the traction will be on the front wheels (as in the previous model).",

C\u2019est pourquoi, nous activons des leviers au niveau r\u00e9gional\".\"Anticiper pour \u00e9viter\u00a0les fermetures\" L\u2019un d\u2019eux est la Force d\u2019intervention des mutations automobiles (FIMA), une coproduction de l\u2019\u00c9tat et de la r\u00e9gion. \"L\u2019objectif est d\u2019aller visiter les 300 sous-traitants de la fili\u00e8re pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles disposent d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie face \u00e0 cette mutation. Nous en avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 visit\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9, indique le vice-pr\u00e9sident. Soit ces entreprises sont capables de basculer vers l\u2019\u00e9lectrique, soit nous les aidons \u00e0 se diversifier vers d\u2019autres fili\u00e8res comme l\u2019a\u00e9ronautique ou la D\u00e9fense\". En 2022, le budget r\u00e9gional de cette force d\u2019intervention s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 23 millions d\u2019euros. \"Dans l\u2019Yonne, nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 impact\u00e9s par la fermeture de Benteler \u00e0 Migennes et Marelli \u00e0 Saint-Julien-du-Sault, d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019importance d\u2019anticiper en accompagnant, diversifiant mais \u00e9galement en maintenant les comp\u00e9tences sur le territoire\". Une strat\u00e9gie qui passera \u00e9galement par l\u2019hydrog\u00e8ne, fili\u00e8re que la R\u00e9gion\u00a0s\u2019emploie \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper. Hugo Raymond",
